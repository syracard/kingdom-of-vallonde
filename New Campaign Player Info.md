Hi thanks for your interest in the new campaign! I'll be putting some info here for you to consider and think about while we get ready for Session 0 and getting the game fired up. 

**Character Creation:** We'll be starting at level 5. Basically anything is game, just ask me about it if it's a 3rd party source or Unearthed Arcana. 
I'm feeling a standard 4d6 randomization for stats, but I'm open to other generation methods.
	*A simple checklist*
		1. Ancestry
		2. Class
		3. Background
		4. Are you hiding a secret?
		5. Are you connected to any of the other characters?
		6. What are your short, medium, and/or long term goals? (These can either be as a player or as a character). 

**World Location:** The game will take place in my homebrew world of Osstor in the year 770, Age of Kings. There are some different locations that we can explore as the primary setting in the world (of course ya'll could always just fuck off and go somewhere else). In no particular order they are [[Conclave|the Island of Conclave]], [[The Denitric Archipelago|the Denitric Archipelago]], and [[The Fringewood|the Fringewood]]. 

My basic thought for this game is that you all are members of an organization, recently achieving full membership status and going on your first mission. I've got some thoughts, but if you guys have some ideas on what you'd like to do instead please give me your suggestions. 
 1. Exiled house from [[The Sister Cities|Keyhearth]]. 
 2. Dispatched to investigate rumors of a divine artifact. 
 3. Members of [[The Pickling Guild]] sent to investigate increased extraplanar activity.
I'd also like to know how much you want the campaign to be your characters pursuing their own goals or having goals presented to you to go after.

You should also think about the D&D 'pillars' that you want to focus on. 
 - Roleplaying
 - Politics
 - Combat
 - Exploration
 - Crafting



**Potential House Rules** None of these are set in stone, just stuff to consider. When we decide what all we're using I'll make a new reference page for it. Reach out if you have any suggestions!
	**2014 vs 2024?** The new rules are coming out in the beginning of September. Do we want to use them? We can always begin with playtest material and then convert anything to the 'official' release when it comes out. 
	**A dedicated crafting system**
		There's detailed crafting rules from *Loot Table* sources. This includes things like collecting components from monsters and then using them to craft new mundane/supernatural items. 
	**Strongholds and Followers, and Kingdoms and Warfare**
		These are rules for building strongholds, recruiting followers, developing an organization, and prosecuting wars against other factions. All while controlling your own armies and managing their units! 
	**Healing**
		*Healer's Kit Dependency:* A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds.
		*Healing Surges:* This optional rule allows characters to heal up in the thick of combat and works well for parties that feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for campaigns in which magical healing is rare. 
		As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 
		A character who uses a healing surge can't do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. 
		Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one die).
		*Slow Natural Healing:* Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.
	**Resting: Gritty Realism:** This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to engage in too many battles in a row. and all adventuring requires careful planning.
	**Some More Tactical Combat Options**
		*Disarm:* A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. 
		The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.
		*Mark:* When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.
		*Flanking:* You know what this means.
	**Damage: Lingering and Massive**
		*Lingering Injuries:* Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. 
		It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under the following circumstances: 
		When it takes a critical hit 
		When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright 
		When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more 
		To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types.

		*Massive Damage:* When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

	**Dazed:** A dazed creature can only do one of the following things on their turn: move, use an action, or use a bonus action. If a creature becomes dazed during their turn, their turn ends. The cure ailment power, lesser restoration spell, and greater restoration spell remove the dazed condition. At the GM’s discretion, other powers, spells, or effects might also remove the dazed condition. 
	When a dazed creature is affected by a spell or effect that gives them an extra action on their turn (like the haste spell or the fighter’s Action Surge feature), they can still take this extra action, in addition to the movement, action, or bonus action allowed by the dazed condition. 
	**Companion Creatures (1 per party):** A companion is a wild ally who adventures with characters. Each companion has unique traits and actions that make them a great ally. But beware! These creatures can be difficult to control in the heat of battle and just might bite the hand that feeds. Don’t fret too much, though! A companion gelatinous cube or owlbear is worth the risk of an occasional wild rampage.
	I've got more rules for companion creatures, but we can go over them if we decide to use them. 
	**The Action Point:** You can spend an action point on your turn to take an extra action in combat. If you have already cast a spell on that turn, this action may be a spell of 2nd level or lower.
	You regain all spent action points after recovering from a long rest.
	**Factions and Organizations:** Do you guys want some sort of tracking of relations and loyalties with different factions, groups, and organizations that you meet? I'm thinking a basic scale like *Hated*, *Rival*, *Suspicious*, *Neutral*, *Friendly*, *Trusted*, *Allied*. 


**Anything Off Limits?** If there are any themes or topics you want to totally avoid let me know. D&D should be fun not traumatizing!
