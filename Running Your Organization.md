# Basics
At the beginning of each week you can direct your organization to take an action(s) based on your organization rank. 
## Organization Actions
**Recruit:** Make a Charisma check (DC determined by your organization size). If you succeed, you increase your organization size die. 

| Size | DC  |
| ---- | --- |
| 0    | 5   |
| d4   | 10  |
| d6   | 15  |
| d8   | 20  |
| d10  | 25  |
| d12  | 30  |
| d20  | 35  |
**Rank Up:** You increase the size of your organization, gaining access to more actions and agents. 

| Org Size | HQ Size | Cost (gp) |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| d4       | n/a     | 500       |
| d6       | 1       | 1000      |
| d8       | 2       | 2000      |
| d10      | 2       | 3000      |
| d12      | 3       | 6000      |
| d20      | 3       | 10,000    |

**Rank** (The power and influence of your organization): 0
	**Combat Actions:** 1
**Size** (The number of people in your organization): 0
# Agents
Agents are hirelings or allies whom you have fully recruited into your organization. Agents are committed and loyal to your organization (meaning you can trust them; they won't be pulling any shenanigans). 

Caterina Ruzzini
	*Gather Intelligence:* Catrina looks for leads on jobs, quests, or other opportunities. 
	*Recruitment Efforts:* Works with organization leadership to increase recruitment efforts. You have advantage on any **Recruit** checks you make this week. 

# Combat Actions
Your organization gives you access to certain actions in combat. These use an action by default, but some may be bonus actions or reactions. Any character in the party can use one of these actions, but as a group you can only use them a certain number of times (determined by your **Organization Rank** and other factors) before you must return to your HQ and spend a week of downtime. 

**Call in the Boys:** Roll your organization size die. Twice that many Thugs appear to aid you in combat.
