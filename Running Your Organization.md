# Basics
At the beginning of each week you can direct your organization to take an action(s) based on your organization rank. 
## Organization Actions
**Recruit:** Make a Charisma check (DC determined by your organization size). If you succeed, you increase your organization size die. 

| Size | DC  |
| ---- | --- |
| 0    | 5   |
| d4   | 10  |
| d6   | 15  |
| d8   | 20  |
| d10  | 25  |
| d12  | 30  |
| d20  | 35  |
**Rank Up:** You increase the size of your organization, gaining access to more actions and agents. 

| Org Size | HQ Size | Cost (gp) |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| d4       | n/a     | 500       |
| d6       | 1       | 1000      |
| d8       | 2       | 2000      |
| d10      | 2       | 3000      |
| d12      | 3       | 6000      |
| d20      | 3       | 10,000    |


# Stats
**Rank** (The power and influence of your organization): 2
	**Combat Actions:** 1
**Size** (The number of people in your organization): d6
# Agents
Agents are hirelings or allies whom you have fully recruited into your organization. Agents are committed and loyal to your organization (meaning you can trust them; they won't be pulling any shenanigans). 

**Hirelings vs. Retainers:** Hirelings and Retainers are two different types of agents that can be recruited by your organization. Hirelings primarily join you in combat and dungeon delving. Retainers tend to avoid combat and offer weekly organization actions. 

Caterina Ruzzini (Retainer)
	*Gather Intelligence:* Catrina looks for leads on jobs, quests, or other opportunities. 
	*Recruitment Efforts:* Works with organization leadership to increase recruitment efforts. You have advantage on any **Recruit** checks you make this week. 

Captain Black (Retainer)
	*Portside Rumors:* Captain Black will keep an eye out for any interesting characters who could be hired as a hireling or retainer.
	*It Fell off a Boat:* Captain Black will look to see if any valuable items can be procured from the holds of any ships passing through the harbor. Roll a d20 plus your Organization Rank. 

Berthold and Arlynne Voss (Retainer)
	*Arlynne's Research:* Choose a location, person, artifact, etc. and Berthold and Arlynne will attempt to discover unknown information about them. 
	*Berthold's Blessed Tea:* Berthold prepares a number teabags equal to your Organization Size.

# Combat Actions
Your organization gives you access to certain actions in combat. These use an action by default, but some may be bonus actions or reactions. Any character in the party can use one of these actions, but as a group you can only use them a certain number of times (determined by your **Organization Rank** and other factors) before you must return to your HQ and spend a week of downtime. 

**Call in the Boys:** Roll your organization size die. Twice that many Thugs appear to aid you in combat.
