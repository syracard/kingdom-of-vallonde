 - **Session Review:** 
 > **1 August:** The latest negotiating session began with Duke Damsor naming Snori as his heir and successor to Farbrook Castle. As this excitement died down there was cause for alarm. A crack of lightning and a breach forming across the eastern horizon. Reports came to mages and other representatives alike of something coming after a wave of psychic energy washed across Landry. Before long, the Smallboiz were made aware that the black dragon, Ashardalon had made flight for their location. They prepared along with old friends and allies and dispatched the dragon, his corpse leaving behind nothing but an aged elven man in the evaporating viscera. 
 
 > **18 July:** The Smallboiz arrived in the ruins of Landry where negotiations at the summit began. Between the Coinsguard, Knights of the Black Rose, the lords of Vallonde, and the Smallboiz a new order was worked out for the kingdom. A Council of Three led by a selected lord from the nobility, a representative of the different military factions in the kingdom, and a popularly elected coucilperson will check the authority of the monarch.

 > **27 June:** After recovering from Smallzo's resurrection and other aftermaths from the battle with the Regent, the Smallboiz met with an envoy from General Athlonia who has suggested a summit between the different factions now jockeying for the power vacuum. The heroes left for the ruins of Landry where the summit is to be held.

 > **20 June:** The Smallboiz and the forces of Farbrook Castle recovered from the Regent's attack and celebrated their victory. Flint invoked some magic and brought Smallzo back to life.

 > **13 June:** After arriving at Farbrook Castle in the midst of the chaos of a dragon attack the Smallboiz immediately began climbing the keep stairs to get a view of the situation. Passing an open balcony they saw the Regent perched on the castle walls, resplendent in magical armor, and assaulting the defenders. They engaged her in pitched battle, fighting against the terror of combatting an armored, fully-grown dragon. Piru raged against the heroes with flame and tooth and claw. At the end of the battle Smallzo lay dead next to the corpse of the slain regent. 

 > **6 June:** The Smallboiz absconded from Mayheath with a dragon egg in tow. They investigated the death of small creatures in the area, surmising that it was some sort of mass psychic event. They determined it wasn't an immediate threat with the Regent still possibly on their trail and continued their travels west to Farbrook Castle. They opted to take the passage through the old Dwarven Deep Roads as a safer option. Upon arriving at the basement entrance to the castle, they were surprised to find it unguarded, and even more alarmed from the shouts of soldiers raising the alarm for an imminent attack!
