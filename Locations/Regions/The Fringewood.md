The Fringewood is a dense jungle south of the regions claimed by the cities of [[Dukesfane]], [[Meletis]], and [[Ronsenberg]]. Many years ago an army of goblins sallied forth from the jungle to contest this alliance of cities, but were beaten back by their combined forces under the leadership of [[General Athlonia]]. Now, the peoples of these cities have sufficiently recovered and the border areas restored. Different factions and organizations have begun sending expeditions into the Fringewood chasing stories riches and ancient ruins.
