The Great Forest is the name of the dense woodland that occupies the central region of the [[Tev'ash Empire]] and the northern portions of the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]]. 

The interior of the forest is almost entirely unexplored by most peoples (other than the druids who tend to the groves), and the forest still holds many secrets for those who dare to test it.
