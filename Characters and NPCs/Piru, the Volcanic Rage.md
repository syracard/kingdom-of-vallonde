**From the Journal of Duke Ludwig von Osstun. Dated, Summer, 756, Age of Kings:**

*A decade ago, as the good King Vallo reached a healthy old age of 70 years and his son and only heir, Amil, had disappeared for who knows what... tragedy struck. Assassination? Accident? Or just old age? It was unclear then and time has only muddied the waters. Conflicting stories, rumor, and probable propaganda all contributed to the confusion.*

*In the chaos, the king's most trusted advisor, Giles Scalclotz, took control. He named himself "the 'Steward of the Throne' until such time as a suitable heir to King Vallo's seat can be found." This search did not last long. Within weeks of the farcical search beginning the red dragon, Piru, the Volcanic Rage appeared.*

*Before too long we would come to know her as the Regent of Vallonde. Steward Scalclotz, in all his infinite wisdom and bravery bent the knee as soon as he was given the chance...*

Early in their adventures, the Smallboiz discovered the plot devised by Piru to release the ancient black dragon, Ashardalon, from his extra-planar prison. Recognizing the doom that this spelled, they endeavored to disrupt and end this devious plot.

They have had a few encounters with the Regent. The first occurred when she deceived them in her humanoid form at the Tomb of Emperors. At this time she ventured into the catacombs with the adventurers, witnessing Snori Axebitter claim the legendary *Thimdurr*. At night, she absconded from the party's camp, pilfering the mace, *Blood-Drinker* as she did. 

Our heroes' next encountered the Volcanic Rage after they ventured deep into the Strodfjall Mountains to investigate the Ruins of Osstoria. It was a race against her agents from the Knights of the Black Rose to secure the site and the secrets that laid buried. Upon completion of their task, the Smallboiz fled and hid from Piru's gaze in the mountain passes before finding refuge at Fort Hellion. 

Piru assaulted Fort Hellion with her own might and by releasing the demon Sibriex from *Blood-Drinker*. The demon was dispatched and the heroes fought off Piru, forcing her to flee to her roost at Dorian's Rest.
