Barto Trume is one of [[Baron John Brunis]]'s captains. He led the soldiers who had been dispatched to deal with the brigands. His group was defeated by the brigands and after he was captured Barto was charmed by evil magics and forced into the service of his enemies. 

When the party met him along the road to Waycombe he attempted to entice them to the copse of trees north of the town where unbeknownst to them the dragon Aulicus lay in wait. However, the party saw through the magics of the charms and managed to dispel them. Once freed from the charm Trume apologized for his deception and shared some information with the party: 
1. His troop was attacked by a band of brigands. The little old man who stopped them was obviously, thinking back on it, a magic user--"a dark cleric or some other fell priest most like". 
2. Most of his men were killed or taken prisoner.
3. Trume was knocked unconscious and taken somewhere deep in the Great Southern Swamp. Some terrible evil lurks there, although he cannot remember what it is. 

After he shared this information with the party Barto recovered from some of his injuries and began his journey back to Vendare.
