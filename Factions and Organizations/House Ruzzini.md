![[Coat_of_Arms_of_the_House_of_Ruzzini.svg]]
House Ruzzini is one of the guild families of [[The Sister Cities|Keyhearth]]. They specialize in cartography, legal documentations, and (on the illicit side) forgeries. 

The Ruzzini were always a family of moderate station; they made their wealth by leveraging their control of maps and charts that are integral for Keyhearth's maritime trade but were never considered one of [[The Five Families]]. Over the past few decades, they have managed to increase their position due to the increased trade through the relatively new [[the Fynwold Canal|Fynwold Canal]] and the reduction of internal tensions within Vallonde. 

The mark of Ruzzini ascension has been the marriage between the son of the head of the family, Fernando, and the daughter of the duke of Osstun, Caterina. This move hasn't been accepted by all and has been the alleged spark behind the recent terrorist actions of the Sons of Keyhearth.
