The Ryvelegar War is the name of the conflict that happens roughly every ten to fifteen years across [[Conclave]]. 

It was inspired by an ancient ruler, the first and only emperor of conclave, who managed to subdue the entire continent. Upon his succession, so the story goes, an item, [[The Bloodstone]], was forged from his blood. Whoever could claim the stone would be the unquestioned heir of the empire he left behind. 

Of course, none of the presumptive successors were able to find the Bloodstone and the island devolved into a bloody, years long conflict: The First Ryvelegar War. The victor, lacking the right to name themselves emperor, instead was named the Ryvelegar, or Warchief. 

Since then, every generation or so a new Ryvelegar War springs up as the old warchief loses favor and alliances shift.
