# The Knowledge Pool System (kudos to [/u/wolfdreams01](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/40ky7k/he_complete_librarians_handbook/))
Each book, tome, etc. has a **knowledge pool** (the amount of information that can realistically be gained from the item). When you read the book you decide on the level of attention you're giving it (Skimming (1 minute), Browsing (1 hour), or cover-to-cover (8 hours)). These decisions will determine the amount of information that you're able to gain from it. 
1.  Decide the level of attention that you'll be giving this read. If you've already read this book at this level of detail, then you have disadvantage. If you're Browsing, the DC is doubled. If you're Skimming, the DC is tripled. 
2. Each point above the DC that you succeed by adds one to the knowledge pool that you'll be able to use to gain information. 
3. You may spend 2 points of your accrued knowledge pool to gain one piece of useful information chosen by the DM. You may spend 5 points of the knowledge pool to ask the DM a question relevant to the topic that the book could reasonably possess.

# Lingering Injuries and System Shock
## Lingering Injuries
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. 
When it takes a critical hit 
When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright 
When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more 
To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types.

## System Shock
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

# The Action Point
You can spend an action point on your turn to take an extra action in combat. If you have already cast a spell on that turn, this action may be a spell of 2nd level or lower.
You regain all spent action points after recovering from a long rest.
