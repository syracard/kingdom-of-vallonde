# Lingering Injuries and System Shock
## Lingering Injuries
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. 
When it takes a critical hit 
When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright 
When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more 
To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types.

## System Shock
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

# The Action Point
You can spend an action point on your turn to take an extra action in combat. If you have already cast a spell on that turn, this action may be a spell of 2nd level or lower.
You regain all spent action points after recovering from a long rest.
