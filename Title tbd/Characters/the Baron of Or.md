John Brunis is the fifth (and current) baron of [[Or]] on the eastern coast of [[Conclave]]. 

The current baron is a just and devout ruler. He follows in the footsteps of his forebears, keeping himself out of the wider politics and wars of Conclave, focusing on keeping the peace and allowing trade and commerce through his lands. 

He relies heavily on guidance from his high priest, [[Jorlon]].
