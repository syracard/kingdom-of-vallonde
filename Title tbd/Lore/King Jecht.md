A mythical figure in the history of [[Conclave]]. 

The smallfolk believe him to have forged a resistance to the terror of illithid and dragons during [[The Age of Dominion]]. In their eyes his story is connected to [[the Bloodstone]]; only one of his heirs will be able to claim the stone and reforge his domain.
