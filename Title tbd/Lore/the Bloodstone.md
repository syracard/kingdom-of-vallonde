The Bloodstone is an ancient artifact that is hidden somewhere on Conclave (location tbd). 

It is connected to an ancient myth, the origin of which can most likely be traced to [[The Age of Dominion]]. 

**What the general population thinks it is:** An artifact of immense power imbued with power from the blood of [[King Jecht]] who had ruled Conclave during the Age of Dominion and resisted the rule of illithid and dragons. A common addition to the myth has been that only someone from Jecht's bloodline will be able to claim the stone. 

**What scholars think it is:** Men of learning and letters don't have such a parochial view of what this artifact might be. There are a few competing theories, but the most dominant one is that the Bloodstone is most likely the remnant of some sort of arcane experimentation done in ages past. 

**What it actually is:** It is a condensed remnant of a demon lord.
