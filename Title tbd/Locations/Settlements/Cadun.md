# Districts

## Canal District
*A series of deep, long dried up canals striates the southwestern district of the city. Long ago, the mages who built Cuthbert Castle attempted an irrigation project to increase the yield of the farmlands throughout the region. Now, though, the mages dead and their magics ceased, the canals cut through the city, flooding with the rains and acting as a shantytown of sorts for the poorest of Cadun when the weather is dry.*

### Locations
**[[Wina's Keep]]**
	The ruins of a six-sided keep stand among the dried canals of the district. No one lays claim to them and they provide more substantial shelter to some of the poor than the shanties they construct in the canal beds. The teyrn's soldiers not seem to pay it much heed apart from occasionally sweeping the ruins under the guise of public safety.  
	**DC 15 Streetwise:** *'Streetwise' uses Charisma or Wisdom and you have proficiency if you have a Criminal (or other similar) background.* Speaking with some of the people who have made these ruins their home and are passing through the immediate area, you learn that there is a rumored undercroft of the tower that has been sealed since the tower was leveled by magical destruction. 
	**DC 15 Perception:** As you examine the ruins you recognize that whatever structure this once was was constructed at a central nexus point of the canals. 
	**DC 20 Investigation:** Sifting through some of the rubble after a few mangy-looking folks skitter away from you, you uncover a flagstone beneath some of the impromptu campsites. The markings indicate that it is an entry to some sort of underground complex but it is unclear if this stone was meant to keep looters out, or to keep something in. 
**The Crossed Hammers**
	A dwarven tavern. Probably the only stone structure in this part of the city that isn't in ruins. It is run by Erehrt (He/Him), an auburn haired dwarf. 
	**Notice Board:** The Crossed Hammers notice board has one flyer that catches your eyes. 
		**Baron Brunis' Request:** The baron of Or, John Brunis is requesting aid. Merchant caravans going south from Vendare have reported attacks from bandits and marauders. There is a substantial reward for any group who is able to assist the baron with this matter.

## Jeweler's District
### Locations

## Shield Pier
*The Shield Pier is the oldest part of Cadun. It is built around the teyrn's fortress, [[Cuthbert Castle]]. Due to this it is the center of the teyrn's power within the city and acts as a de facto capital of Ebeorht's demense.* 
### Locations

**Aeron's Masonry**
	This is the workshop of [[Aeron]]. a stonemason who works within the city. His job primarily entails maintaining Cuthbert Castle for the teyrn.

**Cuthbert Castle**
	Cuthbert Castle is the seat that Teyrn Ebeorhdt rules from. It sits along the docs, overlooking the bay; defending against any incursions by sea.
