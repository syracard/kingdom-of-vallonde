This period of [[Osstoria]] history followed [[The Age of Dominion]]. It began when what would become the [[Tev'ash Empire]] rose up with the help of the remnants of [[Jotunkung]] against [[The Illithid Empire]]. This conflict began the rivalry between Giantfolk and Dwarves when emperor [[Tev'ash I]] betrayed the Giants to take what was left of their kingdom's wealth. 

This period saw the rise of the Dwarven empire as well as other civilizations throughout Osstoria. It ended with the decline of the empire under [[Emperor Krator]].
