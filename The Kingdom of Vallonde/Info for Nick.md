## The Kingdom of Vallonde
This is the kingdom where most of the adventuring has happened so far. It is a small kingdom south of the declining dwarven empire. Roughly ten years ago the king was assassinated in a coup and has been ruled by the tyranny of a red dragon. This tension is beginning to come to a head and you've been hearing rumors of a potential civil war as the wayward heir may have survived the coup. 

A central figure of these rumors is a new adventuring party, The Small Boys, who have apparently inserted themselves into the political affairs of the kingdom. 

## The City of Agros

Agros is a city in the dwarven empire that was once the economic heartland before it began to decline. **This is where you have recently arrived.** Upon your arrival, it's clear that the city is currently in the midst of some sort of upheaval. The lower classes who live outside the walls in the slums have risen up and besieged the city after a particularly harsh winter. However, the thing that brought you here was new information on the group that may have led to the downfall of your family: Riswynn Battlehammer, one of the economic leaders of the city, has information on the group that gave you your initial faulty orders.
