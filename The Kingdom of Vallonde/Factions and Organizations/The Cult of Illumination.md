A cult mainly of intellectuals and scholars who have discovered some secret of the universe that they have called 'Illumination.' 
The main focus of their rituals is the sacrifice of the body for the development and eventual 'ascension' of the mind. The most common of which is removing one's eye in order to gain 'greater sight.' 

The [[Small Boys]] encountered a small group of them in the Underdark and when they investigated [[Grundi Manor]] they discovered that the creature who had manipulated Snorri was related to the cult.
