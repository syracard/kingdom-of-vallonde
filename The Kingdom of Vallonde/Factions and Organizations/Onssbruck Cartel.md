The Onssbruck Cartel is a loose alliance of business interests who control the industries and business in [[Agros]]. They are led by the Battlehammer Trading Company, Hammerstone Mines, and the Lutgher Guild.

Through the particularly brutal winter of Kings 756 the cartel used their influence over the imperial administration of the city ([[Anbera Balderk]]) and the legionary garrison ([[Alphonse Kallis]]) in order to crack down on unrest in the city and secure the little food imports for themselves and their cronies. 

By the time the [[Small Boys]] arrived in the spring of 757 the tensions had bubbled to the point where the lower classes, led by [[Orville Wrightson]] and [[Harold Threeblood]], had a led a revolt that was besieging the city. The heroes attempted to prevent an outright conflict between the different sides by meeting with General Kallis and the Cartel leaders. 

Tensions were high between the Small Boys and the Cartel leaders over their dinner in the upper level of the Hivehand Meadery. They noticed the gaze of [[Ashyra, Keeper of the Crypt]], the Cartel's bodyguard from the [[Immortal Legion]], keeping watch. While Smallzo saw through her illusions to recognize her undead form, as the tensions rose battle came with two words from [[Riswynn Battlehammer]], "Kill them."
