A union of[[The Knighthood of Bane]], [[The Syndicate of Bhaal]], and [[The Coven of Myrkul]]. Their tenets are tyranny, murder, and featly through death. Their alliance is tenuous in the best of times. While each sect is working towards the ends of their own deity, they recognized that there were benefits to them working together. Rarely do they actively work together towards a united goal, this is usually a great act of evil to destabilize the world in a way that they might leverage greater power and influence of their own. When they arenâ€™t working towards a larger goal the cult acts as a network for its members to take mercenary jobs and avoid any trouble with their adversaries that they might get into. _See Descent into Avernus pp. 231-235._
