The Immortal Legion is an interdimensional mercenary company who offer their services to the highest bidder in mundane, magical, and planar conflicts throughout the multiverse. The group was founded by [[Lord Soth]], a former death knight of Bane. The legion no longer serves Bane and instead, while their major focus on hiring themselves out to other organizations, they also find prospective warriors who might be inclined to continue fighting through undeath.
