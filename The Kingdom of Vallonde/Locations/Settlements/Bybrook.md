A small village in the northwest of the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]]. A small stream cuts through it, providing the residents with fresh water and the occasional fish. No one, save for maybe [[Mayor Ilin Nere]], remembers which handful of families founded the town, but none seem to care about that sort of pomp and ceremony either. Bybrook is a simple town filled with simple people, most just looking to make it through the next drought or winter without losing a friend or family member.
It has been some time since Bybrook has had a mayor. Instead Ilin Nere has administered the town for the past few decades. Elder Nere, as the townsfolk have come to call him, grew up along the stream almost a century ago before leaving to explore the world and his gift of arcanum. When he came to the end of his adventuring career he retired to his hometown where he found them in need of guidance and wisdom that could provide.

**Notables:**
	Elder Nere

	[[Captain Flosial]]

**Points of Interest:**
	The Scoundrel's Pub
		A simple inn and tavern, Gamal runs a modest operation that imports some finer Dwarven spirits through his familial connections with the [[Onssbruck Cartel]].
	General Store
		Once the center of the Hucrele family's operations in town, it has sat gathering dust since Madam Hucrele's demise. However, a local, [[Gyles Cave]] has expressed interest in taking over the business if a Hucrele heir cannot be found.
