The caverns beneath [[Dorian's Rest]] are primarily inhabited by orcs recruited by [[Piru, the Volatile]]. They have been restlessly waiting for her plan to be executed so they can raid and become her new policing force. 

**A:** The narrow passageways you have been following begin to widen as you enter the cavern network underneath Dorian's Rest. 
	*Orc Patrol:* There is a patrol of orcs ahead. DC 17 Perception (Wisdom) to detect them. DC 18 Stealth (Dexterity) to avoid their detection. 
	*Encounter:* Orc Blade of Ilneval, 2 Orc Hands of Gruumsh, and Orc Terranova
**B:** You see a coastal entrance to the caverns. Above, the rocky outcrop shields this small beach from the cold rain coming down overhead. Sitting in the middle of the surf is a large, fifteen-foot-tall statue of a kneeling giant holding a massive sword in front of it. As you enter the area the statue comes to life, revealing itself as a waiting stone giant and the orcs in the passageway ahead advance to investigate the commotion.
	*Encounter:* 1 Basalt Stone Giant (FM, 118) and 3 Orc Ramparts
**C:** At the center of this round chamber is a large fire pit. There are charred fish, lizards, and small voles on skewers that have been roasted and mostly eaten, bedrolls laid out along the rim of the chamber, and there are casks of ale and sour wine. 
	*Tripwire:* The entrance to his chamber is trapped with a tripwire across the passage. It's crudely hidden (DC 14), presumably so none of the cavern's inhabitants trigger it in the middle of the night. When triggered, a large tree trunk swings down from the ceiling and releases hanging pots and pans that bang and clatter loudly, echoing throughout the caverns. 
		Save DC: 15 Dexterity
		Damage: 4d10 bludgeoning damage
**D:** There are stalagtites and stalagmites in the center of this cavern that create a small chamber. You can hear a chanting coming from the chamber and see the sillouettes of orcs at the entrances to the small chamber. 
	*Encounter:* Druid of the Old Ways, 2 Orc Bloodrunners, and 2 Orc Conduits. At the beginning of the encounter the druid instructs one of their underlings to go alert Raskovar and the Deathsworn.
	*Treasure:* Collected amongst the druid's shrine is 1500gp. 
**E:** At the far end of this chamber is a large wood and bone throne upon which sits Raskovar, the leader of these orcs, attended by his Deathsworn. Along the eastern wall is the collection of loot that they have collected over the years. 
	*Encounter:* Raskovar and 3 Orc Deathsworn.
	*Treasure:* 5000gp, a collection of 15 sapphires (1000gp each), and a +1 metal buckler. 
	*Rasokvar's Gear:* +2 chain shirt, +2 war mace, 1d4 Dohma's Brew(s)
