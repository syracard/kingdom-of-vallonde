Odric was an adventurer who was turned into a vampire by [[Strahd]]. He managed to escape [[Barovia]] and wandered Osstoria on his own until he fell into the service of [[General Athlonia]] who employed her as the commander of her intelligence operation. 

While commanding some of [[The Coinsguard]] in [[The Sister Cities]], Odric met the [[Small Boys]]. At first, he offered them reward if they assassinated [[Ludwig von Osstun |Duke Ludwig]], but the heroes rejected the offer after meeting the duke. Odric tried to arrest them after they had allied themselves with the interests of Osstun. They defeated Odric, but he was not destroyed. 

Later, Odric approached the Small Boys at night while they were travelling, extending a parley from Athlonia. At this point, Odric was wielding the greatsword, [[Zealcleaver]]. His offer was rejected and Odric was defeated a final time before his final confrontation with the heroes. 

Sometime later, the Small Boys confronted Odric at [[The Gold Keep]], bound him to his coffin, and destroyed him.
