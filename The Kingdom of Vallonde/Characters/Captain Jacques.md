Jacque grew up in [[The Sister Cities|Osstun]] with [[Bryelly]]. Despite coming from the wrong side of the straights, he managed to join [[The Coinsguard]] and rose through the ranks to captain. 

He met the [[Small Boys]], after they name dropped Bryelly when they first arrived in [[Golon]] where he was in command of the garrison. 

Despite his loyalties to the guard, he recognized that these heroes were on the right side of things and offered them protection and aide when they had been labelled criminals by [[General Athlonia]] and [[Captain Odric]]. For his efforts he was rewarded with a demotion. 

Since Jacques' demotion he has been disgruntled by Keyhearth policy and has been working with [[Ludwig von Osstun|Duke Ludwig]] in secret to provide intel on the Coinsguard, using the Small Boys assassination of Odric as a cover for his espionage.
