Aegleforth is an elder Grand Duke of [[Dukesfane]]. He has led the city through the victory over the goblinoids as well as the strengthening of the bonds of [[The Republican Alliance]]. 

It was reported that he was particularly close with [[General Athlonia]] and while he will dismiss those rumors, the truth is that his eldest son, [[Aethward]], was born to Athlonia and not the duke's lawful wife.
