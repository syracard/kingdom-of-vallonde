Queen Sama is the current ruler of [[Abanzbazzan]]. She is a reformer who wants to push the Drow of the city away from their more aggressive and xenophobic past. 

[[Webweaver Iosefka]] is her main advisor. 

She met the [[Small Boys]] when they followed evidence of abductions on the surface to her city. She worked with them to discover the plot that was led by her sister, [[Princess Nazia Awhad]]. After this she brokered a deal with the heroes to trade with her city and monitor the anchor outside  [[Webweaver Keep]] for any [[The Order of the Black Rose]] agents.
