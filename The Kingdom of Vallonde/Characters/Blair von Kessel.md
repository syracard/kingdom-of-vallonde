Blair is the ranking member of the [[Last Hearth]] chapter of [[The Pickling Guild]]. 

When the [[Small Boys]] arrive in the city, if they meet him, he will inform them that he's planning a fishing trip into the northern waters of [[the Great Sea]] for rare ingredients. 

**Hook:** Blair has made several attempts to travel to the northern fishing waters so far this season, but something has been roiling the waters making it impossible to reach the fishing grounds. Blair suspects there's some sort of magical interference and he's preparing an expedition to solve the issue. 

# **The Ocean Rift**
## **Part 1**
*Skill Challenge:* Travel north on Blair's boat. DC 14. At initiative count 20 of each round roll on the table below, results that adjust the DC for one round. 

| 1d6 | Result                               |
|:---:|:------------------------------------ |
|  1  | Whirlpools: Increase DC by 2.        |
|  2  | Rough Waters: Increase DC by 1.      |
|  3  | Calm Waters: No effect.              |
|  4  | Northern Currents: Decrease DC by 1. |
|  5  | Strong Winds: Decrease DC by 2.      |
|  6  | Pirates Attack!                      |

**Pirate Encounter:** 
	*As you sail with Blair another ship flying a black flag approaches your ship. Using grappling hooks and ropes, the pirates led by a hobgoblin with flaming eyes assault your ship!*
	During the encounter with the pirates, on initiative count 10 of each round rough waves and whirlpools rock the boats. Each creature must succeed on a DC 12 dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Creatures with the Sailor background or who are proficient in water vehicles have advantage on this saving through. 

## Part 2
*After finding the source of the ocean disturbance: something deep on the ocean floor. To examine it, Blair came prepared with augmented scrolls of waterbreathing that allow for deep water diving. At the ocean floor there is a burgeoning elemental rift. It is currently alternating between different elemental planes. It will do so until it 'settles' on an element. Examining the rift will cause elemental creatures to emerge and attack.*
**Encounter:** On initiative count 10 the rift changes based on the result below. If the current effect is rolled, reroll.

| 1d4 | Result                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | *Earth:* Boulders shoot from the rift. Roll attacks (1d20+5) against each creature within 30 feet of the rift for 4d6 bludgeoning damage.                                            |
| 2   | *Air:* Jets of air whirl around the rift. Each creature within 60 feet of the rift must succeed on a DC 14 Strength save or be pulled 30 feet towards the rift.                      |
| 3   | *Fire:* The water around the rift becomes superheated. Each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the rift takes 2d6 fire damage.                                            |
| 4   | *Water:* The water around the rift churns. Each creature within 15 feet of the rift must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or become Dazed until the end of their next turn. |



After sealing the rift that the Small Boys helped him discover, Blair travelled south seeking answers. He knew that [[Admiral Varcho]] would be arriving in [[The Sister Cities|Keyhearth]] and that he would be able to get some information from him.
