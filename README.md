# The Second Level
The party began their descent to the second level of the tomb. When they started walking down the stairs below the trap door, they triggered a trap that turned the staircase into a slide. As the party began falling down the passage the trap at the end came into full focus: a pool of lava that they were hurtling towards. Vutha and the party's companion, Diego, managed to latch onto the walls and Inxis used an *Entangle* spell to save the rest of the party from a firey doom. 

The second layer of the tomb is a massive cavern. As the party looked around the initial area they noticed a few boulders covering areas where the party could hide. As they went forward they found a large, subterranean river which spanned the entirety of the cavern. However, after a raft mysteriously appeared by the bank, they realized that the raft and the river itself were illusions which covered a number of vats of acid for unsuspecting tomb raiders to fall into. 

The party crossed the river to find a number of burial mounds. Among these they discovered a small, magical pouch that contained some coins. Beyond the burial mounds was a large pyramidal tomb that stretched up to the upper reaches of the cavern. The doors to the tomb itself were impassible: they had no obvious handle and were warded with abjurative magics. 

Farther beyond the tomb was an encampment of lizardfolk soldiers. Using the black priest robes they had recovered earlier, Vutha impersonated a cleric of tomb to convince one of the lizardfolk to help him through the door. The ruse was successful and the soldier opened the door with the passphrase, "Open in the name of Sakatha, the Great King!"
# The Book of Evil
The party continued their explorations of the tomb of Sakatha. In the eastern chambers they found a clerical preparation room where they stole black robes of the tombs priests. Continuing on they found a library that contained a number of books and tomes that contained information on military tactics, demon summoning, and other such things that concern clerics of evil. 

The centerpiece of the room was a large book sitting on a reading stand at the back of the chamber. Upon initial inspection it was open to a diagram of a resurrection ritual which was powered by the sacrifice of life instead of divine magic or raw arcane energies. The book emitted an unnatural presence that disturbed the members of the party who were more attuned to the flows of the natural world. Eventually, Frica cast *identify* to discover that the book is [[The Book of Vile Darkness]]. This tome, an assemblage of the knowledge gained by a number of different evil practitioners of magic from across the ages, was revealed as a physical manifestation of the forces of evil in the multiverse. 

Before they progressed deeper into the tomb, they interrogated their prisoner from the Black Iron Pact, Lady Avalla Deseo. With the aid of convincing spellcraft they learned that Lady Avalla was a member of a group who called themselves the Black Iron Pact. They learned about the operations of the Pact as well as details about the protective magics around their extra-dimensional headquarters: The Cyst.
# Of Bedchambers and Secret Doors
As the party continued to explore the tomb they made their way through the bedchambers of the brigands and their captains they restrained some of them before they found a few secret passageways. They found a tunnel through the foundation of the floor into a room for storing the brigands' stolen loot. They defeated the *Shambling Mound* that guarded the treasure and continued their explorations. 

Farther south among these chambers they came across a worship area that contained a statue of the same demonic entity they had seen earlier in the tomb. This statue was accompanied by a deeply stained black altar. Flanking the altar they uncovered two hidden doors that led to a pair of chambers and looped back around. In the chambers they encountered false doors (some of which were *Mimics* in disguise) as well as a trap door that opened to a stairway descending deeper into the tomb. They decided ensure they had explored all of the current level before going on to the next level of the tomb. 

They tackled the western halls next where they encountered a group that they have since come to know as [[The Black Iron Pact]] in a tense fight between a series of small bedchambers. As the members of the pact approached defeat they began to magically teleport away, however, two members were defeated by the party's successful use of *fireball* and *polymorph* spells. 

Beyond the bedchambers the party discovered an altar chamber where a paladin dedicated to the demon-god of this tomb. They defeated the paladin and then looted the statue of his demon-god as well as the treasure in the paladin's secret chamber. 
# The First Level
Through a secret door in the bas-relief the party discovered the lair of the late dragon, Aulicus, as well as the passage into the first level of the tomb. They descended and thanks to the attentive ears of Inxis they learned that a number of the brigands had prepared an ambush in the first chamber. When they entered, prepared for combat, the room was dark, but their entrance was lit by a spell from a wizard among the brigands. In flashes of arrows, blades, and walls of fire the party dispatched the brigands who had prepared their trap for them. 

After they dealt with this first opposition the party began to explore the structure in earnest. They discovered different chambers of supplies and areas of rest for the brigands as well as a few other adversaries wandering the halls. They encountered demons, undead wights, and more brigands who were roving and patrolling the halls. They discovered the secret study of the wizard who had been working with the brigands and recovered his spellbook. 
# The Tomb in the Swamp
Escorted upon the raft of Stephen DeManis, the party was brought south along the river through the Great Southern Swamp. They came to a great raised mound near the center of the region. The mound of dirt rose out of the swamp waters and DeManis brought them to a staircase which led them up to a landing. At the top of the stairs they beheld a colonnade that went up to a coral bead wall. Upon their approach, the brigands who laid in wait behind the wall revealed themselves and sprung their trap. 

This was not the first trap that the party came upon in the tomb of the lizard king. Water Weirds emerged and attacked from wells in the colonnade. After they defeated the elementals, the party investigated a [[Demonic Bas-Relief.jpg|bas-relief statue]] at the back of the chamber which depicted a powerful demonic being. The statue was flanked by coral mosaics that depicted battles between lizardfolk and other armies one one side, and a huge lizardfolk king wielding a gem-encrusted scepter kneeling before the demonic figure. 

# The Defeat of Aulicus
After their brief foray into the celestial realms, Tyrael returned the party back to where he had plucked them from just as their battle with Aulicus resumed. Through clever spellcraft they managed to ground the dragon with a *Polymorph* spell before magically blinding and then defeating the threat. 

They assessed the brigands' outpost in the copse such as it was before they ventured into Waycombe proper. In the town they met the innkeeper, Busby, who was preparing to leave the following morning with the last of his worldly possessions to join his family who had already left. It was clear that anything of value in the town had already been looted by the brigands and most of the homes had been burnt. In their conversations with Busby the party learned that there was one more 'resident' of the town, [[Stephen DeManis]] who lived in a hut south of town closer to the swamp. 

When the party approached DeManis's hut they could hear his crazed ramblings form into a singsong chant: 

*They all thinks I'm crazy, so crazy I am;*
*But I'll sill be here when they ain't what they am!*
*They'll all be taken to Sakatha's lair,*
*But me I'll be free as a bird in the air!*

They sat and conversed with DeManis and convinced him to escort them to Sakatha's lair on his raft. 
# Send Me an Angel
The party decided to continue on to Waycombe and turn the ambush on their enemies. They approached the copse from the north. They spotted one of the brigands' lookouts and jumped into action. As they lit the evening with magical fires they were astonished as a black dragon emerged from the center of the copse of trees. He roared his name, "[[Aulicus, Lord of the Swamp]]," but before he was able to engage the party they were teleported away from the battle. They found themselves in a clear, white void where they beheld a Celestial figure: [[Tyrael]], Commander of the Platinum Legion. 

Tyrael dispatched different celestial warriors at the party in order to determine their combat abilities. After he was satisfied he informed them that there were greater evils threatening the world of Osstor, and if they succeeded in defeating the darkness in the Swamp then he would come to them again to tell them more about what this threat might be. 
# Another Ambush
In a hard fought battle the party dispatched the ambush of Lizardfolk on the Great Bridge of Ardo and after they recovered from their wounds continued along the road to [[Waycombe]]. Along the road they encountered [[Barto Trume]]. Through their conversation the party learned that Barto's men had been defeated and captured by the brigands the party had been sent to investigate. However, they gleaned that this soldier of [[Vendare]] had been put under some magical enchantment that had directed him to lead the party towards a trap. They cleared his mind and he confessed that the brigands took his men into the Swamp and not to the copse of trees north of Waycombe. After he shared this information and rested with the party, Barto began his return to Vendare. 

# Session 25: 6 March. Ambush on the Great Bridge!
The party continued on their travels to Waycombe until they came to the Great Bridge spanning the River Ardo. At the halfway point, a large group of Lizardfolk crawled out from underneath to ambush the party. Our heroes managed to defeat this trap before they continued across the bridge. 

# Session 24: 27 February. General Recap and the Travel to Waycombe.
After defeating the crazed and self-proclaimed Rat King, our heroes took a few days to recover and pursue their own goals before ensuring that Bryce Halfheart's curse had been cured. On the way out of town they decided to investigate [[the Temple of the Dual Pantheon]] after they had discovered that the *Identify* spell Frica was taught by [[Eustice, Cleric of Revelation]], monitored the identified items. 

The group absconded with the [[Book of Records]] and successfully dispelled the tracking spell on it before they decided that it would be best to leave the city for a while to let things cool off and pursue their interests outside of Cadun. 

Towards the beginning of their journey they veered from the road to check out a set of ruins that Kriv had learned about. To their surprise, Sorin's parents, [[Berthold Voss|Berthold]] and [[Arlynne Voss|Arlynne]] Voss, were encamped there with their hired guardian, [[Sir Gordon Chumway]]. At the ruins, they discovered that the chapel here were once occupied by clerics who secretly worshipped [[Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath]]. They also learned that this site may have also been connected to the artifact, [[The Bloodstone]]. 

Before leaving the ruins Diego caught up with the party from the city. He brought word from Caterina that she was handling things in the city and he had been tasked with delivering a *Sending Stone* to them so that they could communicate with Caterina. 

Continuing on their travels, our heroes encountered a group of Shadow Mastiffs: extraplanar hounds that suggest there is some sort of planar passage to either the Shadowfell or the Feywild. 

Eventually they arrived at Vendare and made straight for the baron's palace. They were interviewed by Baron John Brunis and his advisor, the cleric Jorlon who decided to accept the party's help. They were brought to a meeting of the merchants and their guards whose caravans had been attacked by the brigands. From them, they learned that the brigands use an old man as bait and use some sort of magical fear to accost the caravans. 

During the meeting one of the attendant clerics revealed himself to be a traitor by casting a *flame strike* spell on the baron, Jorlon, and the party. The party subdued him and decided to immediately set out for Waycombe while Jorlon interrogated the cleric. 

The party travelled south along the road, stopping at the inns on the road. They received word from Jorlon that the traitor was a worshipper of chaotic evil forces, Mordrin, but before he could learn more another traitor in the palace helped Mordrin magically escape. 

The party stopped at the [[Robin's Breast Inn]] on one of the evenings of their travels where they met the minstrel, [[Pluck]], who performed the "[The Ballad of Sakatha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohopWhwDVUo)" for them. That night, while most were asleep, the party spotted and destroyed a group of Lizardfolk who were prowling around the outskirts of the inn. 

# Session 8: 24 October. The First Night in Cadun

# Session 7: 17 October. Bar Crawl Market Brawl!
Upon leaving the Broken Dagger Inn, Inxis spotted a group of individuals in the market: kobolds loading a cart under the direction of an older dwarf. The dwarf's cloak was crimson red with a pair of crossed golden scimitars: the symbol of the Gemini Blades. The party attempted to sneak through the crowds of market goers, but were spotted by the dwarf who ordered his kobold soldiers to apprehend the party. 

Battle ensued in the market. The dwarf grabbed a civilian to use as a human shield and assaulted the party with psionic blasts while his kobolds attempted to capture them. The Kobolds were... ineffective dopes and unable to give much help to their leader as he was mauled by Inxis in his bear-form. 

As the heat of battle died a small girl shouted "Papa! Papa!" as she ran to and embraced Sorin who was wearing the magical disguise of one of the market goers who had fled.
# Session 6: 10 October. Bar Crawl!
Our Keyhearthian exiles decided to explore [[Cadun]] by going on a bar crawl, beginning their morning at the Little Pony Inn and Tavern where they met bartender, [[Dagoth]], and the son of [[Teyrn Ebeorht]], [[Hector Ebeorht]]. Drinks were had and rooms were secured at the Little Pony before the party moved on to the next location. 

They arrived at the Broken Dagger Inn where [[Nidda]] was tending bar and Frica sat down for a conversation with the owner of the establishment, [[Brida]]. Of note, she learned that Teyrn Ebeorht's superior, the Ryvelegar of Conclave is set to visit the city in about three months, motivating the Teyrn to ensure that any major issues in the city or with his vassals are dealt with by the time his liege lord arrives. 

Before leaving to explore the final bar in the city, the party took a look at the notice board that was situated inside the Broken Dagger. There were two notices that caught their attention:

From [[Ilfen Halfheart]]: 
	*Calling all heroes and adventurers!*
	*Looking for any and all willing to search for my son Bryce.*
	*Gold will be rewarded upon completion!*
	*Inquire at Halfheart's Half-Anvil in the Copper Market!*

From [[Baron John Brunis]]: 
	*The lord of the eastern territories, the city of Vendare, the towns of Arth, Newcombe, and Waycombe, and loyal vassal of the Master of the great city of Cadun, Teyrn Ebeorht, the Butcher of Bludmyst, Baron John Brunis requests the aid of brave adventurers.*
	*For over a fortnight the caravans travelling through our southernmost settlement and through the swamp that lies beyond have been raided by bandits. There has been no word from the soldiers sent to deal with the brigands, and the baron requests the service of any adventurers who can discover their fate.*
	*Any who believe they can resolve this issue should report to the palace of Baron Brunis in Vendare.*

# Session 5: 3 October. A Sail Across the Jagd
After securing the pirate's booty which included a sum of gold, a magical scimitar and armor (which was traded to the quartermaster of *The Endeavour*, Mister Banks), a ledger of outstanding bounties, and a gun, the voyage continued. 

As the journey came ever closer to the antarctic seas and their eventual turn westward around the Jagd, from the crow's nest Inxis spotted three ships on the northern horizon. They looked to be about the same size as *The Endeavour* with large, crimson red sails that bore the symbol of crossed, golden scimitars. The crew recognized this insignia as belonging to [[the Gemini Blades]]: infamous bounty hunters according to Captain Black. 

Using the spyglass, Inxis was also able to identify a figure on the prow of the lead ship. With his arm wrapped in rigging to secure himself and a two-handed falchion hovering in the air around him stood a man above the figurehead with a single, burning coal in the place of his left eye. 

As cannonballs began sailing over *The Endeavour* and splashing into the ocean around the ship, the captain ordered an emergency maneuver: hard starboard right into the Jagd. As your ship moved towards the magically affected doldrums, Brynden Blake revealed the tarp-covered machines along the rear of the quarterdeck: two cubic, metal boxes that were connected by corrugated tubing to a central hub. As he fired up the engine a magical field encompassed the ship, granting it flight to climb into the sky and escape the Gemini ships by flying across the otherwise unsailable Jagd Seas. 

Two weeks of sky-sailing brought our Keyhearthian exiles to the shores of Conclave. They anchored in Enchanter's Bay while looking on the city of [[Cadun]]. Captain Black recruited [[Diego]], a Cadun local to provide some insight into the city for the newcomers and act as a guide while they learn the lay of the land. 

![[The Voyage of The Endeavour.jpg]]

 While Caterina plans to go to [[Cuthbert Castle]] to see if a relationship can be made between your group and the lord of the city, [[Teyrn Ebeorht]], you were immediately tasked with finding suitable lodgings for at least the short term. 

In the long-term two major decisions face you: What type of organization do you want to rebuild here? Who do you seek to befriend (if anyone) in the city? The suggestions for your organization were reforming a criminal enterprise, forming a mercenary company, or taking on more traditional adventurer jobs. Your options of powers in the city are the Teyrn, the [[The Sapphire Grove]], or [[Brida]]. 
# Session 4: 26 September. Merfolk and Pirates
The exiles from Keyhearth settled in for their voyage across the seas. After dispatching a few berserkers in their first week it was mostly easy sailing for a time. They spotted a rogue whirlpool and traded with a travelling merfolk merchant. 

At the end of the third week of their travels, *The Endeavour* was accosted by a ship flying the black flag of piracy. The captain identified our heroes as having bounties on their heads and moved in to capture them (along with any booty aboard their ship). After a pitched battle the pirates were defeated, their ship sunk, and the heroes and their allies from *The Endeavour* retrieved some of the booty that the pirates had on their ship. 
# Session 3: 19 September. Setting Sail
Our heroes met Captain Black and [[The Crew of the Endeavour]]. The crew began to quickly loose the sails and go to sea. As they set forth an intense gust of wind--reeking of death and decay--blew across the Kassian Straights and into Keyhearth. It blew into the city, seemingly centered at the point of the conflict with the Bladesinger where a 75-foot pillar of flame erupted into the sky. This invigorated the crew as you sailed out of the port. 

The morning after their escape Caterina and her allies from the Ruzzini family learned that the forces acting against them had quickly distributed wanted posters and brought charges of tax dereliction against the leadership of their family. Sorin recalled an escape plan known only to Ottovio and Fernando that would lead the two of them to Conclave. It was decided there that you would accompany *The Endeavour* on their trip to Conclave with the hopes of meeting any more Ruzzini survivors there. 

Some of the party decided to work with the crew and learn some bit of sailing along the way. During the first week of travel the ship was attacked by roving berserkers who did not seem wholly prepared for sea travel. Despite some close calls, they were dispatched before much damage could be done. 
# Session 2: 12 September. The Docks Aflame
As the rest of our heroes aided in Caterina's escape, Sorin Voss, the Shadow Broker of House Ruzzini, was overseeing the security for the wedding. He leapt into action when the Sons of Keyhearth began their attack, directing the Ruzzini guards to defend the bride and groom. He was too late to join in the initial fray, but caught up with Caterina and his other allies as they fought against a number of forces trying to abscond with the newlywed bride. 

During the fight flames erupted and the wooden structures in this part of the city began burning around our group as they fled into the docks. From this vantage point they could look across the Kassian Straights to see another fire burning in Osstun. Caterina gasped and indicated that it looked like her father's house was the center-point of the blaze. 

As you searched through the docks, the gruff, salty voice of Captain Black came from the deck of his ship. Hooded lanterns shined down on your group, and Caterina was relieved for the first time since the glass windows shattered behind her. 
# Session 1: 5 September. Campaign Intro and Recap
## Intro 
It is the year 770 of the Age of Kings. Twenty year ago [[The War of the Two Dragons]] changed the face of the Kingdom of Vallonde and sparked a renaissance within the region. Among [[The Sister Cities]] of Keyhearth and Osstun, the historical dominance of Keyhearth has become more lenient in recent years due to the changing political landscape. 

The *detente* has gotten to the point that the lord of Osstun, [[Duke Ludwig von Osstun]], has arranged a marriage between his daughter and heir, [[Caterina von Osstun|Caterina]], and the eldest son of one of the leading guild families of Keyhearth, [[Fernando Ruzzini]]. 

But this has not been without resistance. [[The Sons of Keyhearth]], a terrorist organization that has been operating for at least fifteen years and claimed responsibility for an attempted kidnapping of Lady Caterina, has instigated some unrest in the months leading up to the wedding. 

You, our intrepid heroes, are capos of [[House Ruzzini|the Ruzzini family]]. Different circumstances have led each of you to joining and rising through the ranks of the organization that has become your family. Recently your time has been focused on putting down the unrest instigated by the Sons of Keyhearth. 

Tonight, however, is a time of celebration. It is the evening of Fernando and Caterina's wedding. The ceremony has ended and you are gathered at the Ruzzini mansion for the continued festivities. 
## Recap
Our story begins after the wedding ceremony of Fernando Ruzzini and Caterina von Osstun. Inxis, Kriv, Vutha, and Frica were pulled away from the feast to meet with the groom, his father Ottovio, and his new father-in-law Duke Ludwig. Each of our heroes were presented with a magic item as a gift for their service to the Ruzzini family. 

After the gifts were given out the group returned to the reception feast where they were sat at the head table with the rest of the wedding party. As Inxis and Frica mingled with the guests they noticed that there was a commotion among the Ruzzini guards. As Frica followed after the commotion, the large glass windows behind the head table shattered in an explosion. 

In the chaos guests fled and the Sons of Keyhearth invaded the Ruzzini manor. Guards reported that the enemies were assaulting the wedding and had taken control of a Tev'ashi flagship that was docked in the harbor; the shaking mansion from cannon fire confirmed this report. 

After Vutha took care of any injuries from the exploded glass at the head table Duke Ludwig and Fernando jumped to action. The two men held off the invading, white-masked terrorists while Fernando ordered our heroes to help Caterina escape. 

The group of four jumped into action: Vutha blessing some of his allies, Inxis wildshaping into a giant riding lizard for Caterina to ride, and Frica and Kriv guiding a path for the group out of the mansion. Escaping into the streets, Caterina instructed Inxis to head towards the docks; her father had always told her to find Captain Black in the event of an emergency. As they approached, they noticed a small group of Sons of Keyhearth laying in wait for anyone trying to escape through the docks.

With the sound of cannons still coming from the dwarven stoneship sitting on the Kassian Straights and the clatter of combat between the Sons of Keyhearth and the Ruzzini guards, our group planned their next move. As they did, Caterina informed them that her father had sent her a magical message to inform her that there was a bladesinger among their enemies. Frica and Inxis recognized bladesinging as a powerful school of wizardry learned by Eladrin mages that combines arcane knowledge and swordcraft. 

With a stealthy advance and utilizing some illusion magic they got the drop on the trap that was laid for them. As the battle with the Sons of Keyhearth knaves continued, an elven figure floated down from the rooftops. He had a spellbook in one hand and a sword levitated around him. 

The Bladesinger had joined the battle...
