# Session 1: 5 September. Campaign Intro and Recap
## Intro 
It is the year 770 of the Age of Kings. Twenty year ago [[The War of the Two Dragons]] changed the face of the Kingdom of Vallonde and sparked a renaissance within the region. Among [[The Sister Cities]] of Keyhearth and Osstun, the historical dominance of Keyhearth has become more lenient in recent years due to the changing political landscape. 

The *detente* has gotten to the point that the lord of Osstun, [[Duke Ludwig von Osstun]], has arranged a marriage between his daughter and heir, [[Caterina von Osstun|Caterina]], and the eldest son of one of the leading guild families of Keyhearth, [[Fernando Ruzzini]]. 

But this has not been without resistance. [[The Sons of Keyhearth]], a terrorist organization that has been operating for at least fifteen years and claimed responsibility for an attempted kidnapping of Lady Caterina, has instigated some unrest in the months leading up to the wedding. 

You, our intrepid heroes, are capos of [[House Ruzzini|the Ruzzini family]]. Different circumstances have led each of you to joining and rising through the ranks of the organization that has become your family. Recently your time has been focused on putting down the unrest instigated by the Sons of Keyhearth. 

Tonight, however, is a time of celebration. It is the evening of Fernando and Caterina's wedding. The ceremony has ended and you are gathered at the Ruzzini mansion for the continued festivities. 
## Recap
Our story begins after the wedding ceremony of Fernando Ruzzini and Caterina von Osstun. Inxis, Kriv, Vutha, and Frica were pulled away from the feast to meet with the groom, his father Ottovio, and his new father-in-law Duke Ludwig. Each of our heroes were presented with a magic item as a gift for their service to the Ruzzini family. 

After the gifts were given out the group returned to the reception feast where they were sat at the head table with the rest of the wedding party. As Inxis and Frica mingled with the guests they noticed that there was a commotion among the Ruzzini guards. As Frica followed after the commotion, the large glass windows behind the head table shattered in an explosion. 

In the chaos guests fled and the Sons of Keyhearth invaded the Ruzzini manor. Guards reported that the enemies were assaulting the wedding and had taken control of a Tev'ashi flagship that was docked in the harbor; the shaking mansion from cannon fire confirmed this report. 

After Vutha took care of any injuries from the exploded glass at the head table Duke Ludwig and Fernando jumped to action. The two men held off the invading, white-masked terrorists while Fernando ordered our heroes to help Caterina escape. 

The group of four jumped into action: Vutha blessing some of his allies, Inxis wildshaping into a giant riding lizard for Caterina to ride, and Frica and Kriv guiding a path for the group out of the mansion. Escaping into the streets, Caterina instructed Inxis to head towards the docks; her father had always told her to find Captain Black in the event of an emergency. As they approached, they noticed a small group of Sons of Keyhearth laying in wait for anyone trying to escape through the docks.

With the sound of cannons still coming from the dwarven stoneship sitting on the Kassian Straights and the clatter of combat between the Sons of Keyhearth and the Ruzzini guards, our group planned their next move. As they did, Caterina informed them that her father had sent her a magical message to inform her that there was a bladesinger among their enemies. Frica and Inxis recognized bladesinging as a powerful school of wizardry learned by Eladrin mages that combines arcane knowledge and swordcraft. 

With a stealthy advance and utilizing some illusion magic they got the drop on the trap that was laid for them. As the battle with the Sons of Keyhearth knaves continued, an elven figure floated down from the rooftops. He had a spellbook in one hand and a sword levitated around him. 

The Bladesinger had joined the battle...
