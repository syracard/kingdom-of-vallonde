# Session 6: 10 October. Bar Crawl!
Our Keyhearthian exiles decided to explore [[Cadun]] by going on a bar crawl, beginning their morning at the Little Pony Inn and Tavern where they met bartender, [[Dagoth]], and the son of [[Teyrn Ebeorht]], [[Hector Ebeorht]]. Drinks were had and rooms were secured at the Little Pony before the party moved on to the next location. 

They arrived at the Broken Dagger Inn where [[Nidda]] was tending bar and Frica sat down for a conversation with the owner of the establishment, [[Brida]]. Of note, she learned that Teyrn Ebeorht's superior, the Ryvelegar of Conclave is set to visit the city in about three months, motivating the Teyrn to ensure that any major issues in the city or with his vassals are dealt with by the time his liege lord arrives. 

Before leaving to explore the final bar in the city, the party took a look at the notice board that was situated inside the Broken Dagger. There were two notices that caught their attention:

From [[Ilfen Halfheart]]: 
	*Calling all heroes and adventurers!*
	*Looking for any and all willing to search for my son Bryce.*
	*Gold will be rewarded upon completion!*
	*Inquire at Halfheart's Half-Anvil in the Copper Market!*

From [[Baron John Brunis]]: 
	*The lord of the eastern territories, the city of Vendare, the towns of Arth, Newcombe, and Waycombe, and loyal vassal of the Master of the great city of Cadun, Teyrn Ebeorht, the Butcher of Bludmyst, Baron John Brunis requests the aid of brave adventurers.*
	*For over a fortnight the caravans travelling through our southernmost settlement and through the swamp that lies beyond have been raided by bandits. There has been no word from the soldiers sent to deal with the brigands, and the baron requests the service of any adventurers who can discover their fate.*
	*Any who believe they can resolve this issue should report to the palace of Baron Brunis in Vendare.*

# Session 5: 3 October. A Sail Across the Jagd
After securing the pirate's booty which included a sum of gold, a magical scimitar and armor (which was traded to the quartermaster of *The Endeavour*, Mister Banks), a ledger of outstanding bounties, and a gun, the voyage continued. 

As the journey came ever closer to the antarctic seas and their eventual turn westward around the Jagd, from the crow's nest Inxis spotted three ships on the northern horizon. They looked to be about the same size as *The Endeavour* with large, crimson red sails that bore the symbol of crossed, golden scimitars. The crew recognized this insignia as belonging to [[the Gemini Blades]]: infamous bounty hunters according to Captain Black. 

Using the spyglass, Inxis was also able to identify a figure on the prow of the lead ship. With his arm wrapped in rigging to secure himself and a two-handed falchion hovering in the air around him stood a man above the figurehead with a single, burning coal in the place of his left eye. 

As cannonballs began sailing over *The Endeavour* and splashing into the ocean around the ship, the captain ordered an emergency maneuver: hard starboard right into the Jagd. As your ship moved towards the magically affected doldrums, Brynden Blake revealed the tarp-covered machines along the rear of the quarterdeck: two cubic, metal boxes that were connected by corrugated tubing to a central hub. As he fired up the engine a magical field encompassed the ship, granting it flight to climb into the sky and escape the Gemini ships by flying across the otherwise unsailable Jagd Seas. 

Two weeks of sky-sailing brought our Keyhearthian exiles to the shores of Conclave. They anchored in Enchanter's Bay while looking on the city of [[Cadun]]. Captain Black recruited [[Diego]], a Cadun local to provide some insight into the city for the newcomers and act as a guide while they learn the lay of the land. 

![[The Voyage of The Endeavour.jpg]]

 While Caterina plans to go to [[Cuthbert Castle]] to see if a relationship can be made between your group and the lord of the city, [[Teyrn Ebeorht]], you were immediately tasked with finding suitable lodgings for at least the short term. 

In the long-term two major decisions face you: What type of organization do you want to rebuild here? Who do you seek to befriend (if anyone) in the city? The suggestions for your organization were reforming a criminal enterprise, forming a mercenary company, or taking on more traditional adventurer jobs. Your options of powers in the city are the Teyrn, the [[The Sapphire Grove]], or [[Brida]]. 
# Session 4: 26 September. Merfolk and Pirates
The exiles from Keyhearth settled in for their voyage across the seas. After dispatching a few berserkers in their first week it was mostly easy sailing for a time. They spotted a rogue whirlpool and traded with a travelling merfolk merchant. 

At the end of the third week of their travels, *The Endeavour* was accosted by a ship flying the black flag of piracy. The captain identified our heroes as having bounties on their heads and moved in to capture them (along with any booty aboard their ship). After a pitched battle the pirates were defeated, their ship sunk, and the heroes and their allies from *The Endeavour* retrieved some of the booty that the pirates had on their ship. 
# Session 3: 19 September. Setting Sail
Our heroes met Captain Black and [[The Crew of the Endeavour]]. The crew began to quickly loose the sails and go to sea. As they set forth an intense gust of wind--reeking of death and decay--blew across the Kassian Straights and into Keyhearth. It blew into the city, seemingly centered at the point of the conflict with the Bladesinger where a 75-foot pillar of flame erupted into the sky. This invigorated the crew as you sailed out of the port. 

The morning after their escape Caterina and her allies from the Ruzzini family learned that the forces acting against them had quickly distributed wanted posters and brought charges of tax dereliction against the leadership of their family. Sorin recalled an escape plan known only to Ottovio and Fernando that would lead the two of them to Conclave. It was decided there that you would accompany *The Endeavour* on their trip to Conclave with the hopes of meeting any more Ruzzini survivors there. 

Some of the party decided to work with the crew and learn some bit of sailing along the way. During the first week of travel the ship was attacked by roving berserkers who did not seem wholly prepared for sea travel. Despite some close calls, they were dispatched before much damage could be done. 
# Session 2: 12 September. The Docks Aflame
As the rest of our heroes aided in Caterina's escape, Sorin Voss, the Shadow Broker of House Ruzzini, was overseeing the security for the wedding. He leapt into action when the Sons of Keyhearth began their attack, directing the Ruzzini guards to defend the bride and groom. He was too late to join in the initial fray, but caught up with Caterina and his other allies as they fought against a number of forces trying to abscond with the newlywed bride. 

During the fight flames erupted and the wooden structures in this part of the city began burning around our group as they fled into the docks. From this vantage point they could look across the Kassian Straights to see another fire burning in Osstun. Caterina gasped and indicated that it looked like her father's house was the center-point of the blaze. 

As you searched through the docks, the gruff, salty voice of Captain Black came from the deck of his ship. Hooded lanterns shined down on your group, and Caterina was relieved for the first time since the glass windows shattered behind her. 
# Session 1: 5 September. Campaign Intro and Recap
## Intro 
It is the year 770 of the Age of Kings. Twenty year ago [[The War of the Two Dragons]] changed the face of the Kingdom of Vallonde and sparked a renaissance within the region. Among [[The Sister Cities]] of Keyhearth and Osstun, the historical dominance of Keyhearth has become more lenient in recent years due to the changing political landscape. 

The *detente* has gotten to the point that the lord of Osstun, [[Duke Ludwig von Osstun]], has arranged a marriage between his daughter and heir, [[Caterina von Osstun|Caterina]], and the eldest son of one of the leading guild families of Keyhearth, [[Fernando Ruzzini]]. 

But this has not been without resistance. [[The Sons of Keyhearth]], a terrorist organization that has been operating for at least fifteen years and claimed responsibility for an attempted kidnapping of Lady Caterina, has instigated some unrest in the months leading up to the wedding. 

You, our intrepid heroes, are capos of [[House Ruzzini|the Ruzzini family]]. Different circumstances have led each of you to joining and rising through the ranks of the organization that has become your family. Recently your time has been focused on putting down the unrest instigated by the Sons of Keyhearth. 

Tonight, however, is a time of celebration. It is the evening of Fernando and Caterina's wedding. The ceremony has ended and you are gathered at the Ruzzini mansion for the continued festivities. 
## Recap
Our story begins after the wedding ceremony of Fernando Ruzzini and Caterina von Osstun. Inxis, Kriv, Vutha, and Frica were pulled away from the feast to meet with the groom, his father Ottovio, and his new father-in-law Duke Ludwig. Each of our heroes were presented with a magic item as a gift for their service to the Ruzzini family. 

After the gifts were given out the group returned to the reception feast where they were sat at the head table with the rest of the wedding party. As Inxis and Frica mingled with the guests they noticed that there was a commotion among the Ruzzini guards. As Frica followed after the commotion, the large glass windows behind the head table shattered in an explosion. 

In the chaos guests fled and the Sons of Keyhearth invaded the Ruzzini manor. Guards reported that the enemies were assaulting the wedding and had taken control of a Tev'ashi flagship that was docked in the harbor; the shaking mansion from cannon fire confirmed this report. 

After Vutha took care of any injuries from the exploded glass at the head table Duke Ludwig and Fernando jumped to action. The two men held off the invading, white-masked terrorists while Fernando ordered our heroes to help Caterina escape. 

The group of four jumped into action: Vutha blessing some of his allies, Inxis wildshaping into a giant riding lizard for Caterina to ride, and Frica and Kriv guiding a path for the group out of the mansion. Escaping into the streets, Caterina instructed Inxis to head towards the docks; her father had always told her to find Captain Black in the event of an emergency. As they approached, they noticed a small group of Sons of Keyhearth laying in wait for anyone trying to escape through the docks.

With the sound of cannons still coming from the dwarven stoneship sitting on the Kassian Straights and the clatter of combat between the Sons of Keyhearth and the Ruzzini guards, our group planned their next move. As they did, Caterina informed them that her father had sent her a magical message to inform her that there was a bladesinger among their enemies. Frica and Inxis recognized bladesinging as a powerful school of wizardry learned by Eladrin mages that combines arcane knowledge and swordcraft. 

With a stealthy advance and utilizing some illusion magic they got the drop on the trap that was laid for them. As the battle with the Sons of Keyhearth knaves continued, an elven figure floated down from the rooftops. He had a spellbook in one hand and a sword levitated around him. 

The Bladesinger had joined the battle...
