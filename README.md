It is the year 770 of the Age of Kings. Twenty year ago [[The War of the Two Dragons]] changed the face of the Kingdom of Vallonde and sparked a renaissance within the region. Among [[The Sister Cities]] of Keyhearth and Osstun, the historical dominance of Keyhearth has become more lenient in recent years due to the changing political landscape. 

The *detente* has gotten to the point that the lord of Osstun, [[Duke Ludwig von Osstun]], has arranged a marriage between his daughter and heir, [[Caterina von Osstun|Caterina]], and the eldest son of one of the leading guild families of Keyhearth, [[Fernando Ruzzini]]. 

But this has not been without resistance. [[The Sons of Keyhearth]], a terrorist organization that has been operating for at least fifteen years and claimed responsibility for an attempted kidnapping of Lady Caterina, has instigated some unrest in the months leading up to the wedding. 

You, our intrepid heroes, are capos of [[House Ruzzini|the Ruzzini family]]. Different circumstances have led each of you to joining and rising through the ranks of the organization that has become your family. Recently your time has been focused on putting down the unrest instigated by the Sons of Keyhearth. 

Tonight, however, is a time of celebration. It is the evening of Fernando and Caterina's wedding. The ceremony has ended and you are gathered at the Ruzzini mansion for the continued festivities.
