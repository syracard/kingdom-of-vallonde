And some journal updates...

 - The date set for Piru's ritual is 28 June. 
 - **A Short Recap from last session:** The Smallboiz absconded from Mayheath with a dragon egg in tow. They investigated the death of small creatures in the area, surmising that it was some sort of mass psychic event. They determined it wasn't an immediate threat with the Regent still possibly on their trail and continued their travels west to Farbrook Castle. They opted to take the passage through the old Dwarven Deep Roads as a safer option. Upon arriving at the basement entrance to the castle, they were surprised to find it unguarded, and even more alarmed from the shouts of soldiers raising the alarm for an imminent attack!
