Aeron is an elder stonemason who lives and works in the city of [[Cadun (DM)]]. His primary client is Teyrn Ebeorht and maintains the stonework of [[Cuthbert Castle]]. 

One of Aeron's many interests is the many dungeons, ruins, and other structures that dot the map of Or. 

**Hook:** Aeron has gotten wind that part of the criminal element of Rogue's Market has gotten a hold of old schematics for Cuthbert Castle. If someone can recover these for him, he would give them information regarding a regional dungeon. 
	[[Brida]] might be a good contact for this.
