Sakatha, the Great Lizard King, is behind the highway robbery that has been plaguing [[Baron John Brunis (DM)|John Brumis]] and the barony of [[Or]]. 

Some 250 years ago Sakatha came into existence. How this happened no one is sure, for this strange being combined the grotesqueness of lizardfolk with greater intelligence. He has equal shares greed, rapacity, and evil. 

In his lifetime Sakatha came to rule supreme over the lizardfolk of [[the Great Southern Swamp]]. His armies in time extended his rule over the denizens of the Ardo River, and at one time he actually ruled a slave population in all of what is now [[Or]]. 

The extent of his rule brought great wealth to Sakatha, and he was able to employ the services of many powerful and evil mages in his various projects. The greatest task was the building of his own tomb, a vast temple complex hidden in the heart of the swamp, laden with treasure and magical items for Sakatha's use in his afterlife. 

During his days of glory Sakatha also had the great fortune to stumble upon one of the rarest of magic treasures: a **ring of wishes**. Instructed by the mages he employed (and some say despite their treachery), Sakatha used this item to obtain spellcasting powers for himself, eventually achieving status as a 9th level caster. 

However, Sakatha did not always make the wisest use of his ring. His great intelligence was often blinded by his obsessions with self-glorification. A rash deed that would make him appear heroic always appealed more to his selfish, chaotic nature than did a logical, planned course of action. 

It was this weakness that prevented him from using the wish powers of the ring against the inevitable rebellion of the people of Or. Instead, Sakatha fought them himself, riding into battle at the head of his lizardfolk. He was mortally wounded in a great battle by the man who would become the first baron of Or. 

After Sakatha lay dying on the field, his shattered army scattering all around him, he spoke his final wish: that he might live to drink the very blood of those who had defeated him, and the blood of their offspring through the ages. Thus it was that Sakatha, by means of this badly worded dying wish, provided the means for his own return. After 200 years he has come back in a new form, a form suited to fulfill the contents of his wish exactly: Sakatha has awakened as a vampire. 

Sakatha's main goals are to reassert his power over the Great Southern Swamp and Or, and to take horrible revenge on the house of Brumis. His power is very great, but fortunately his chaotic nature makes it difficult for him to maintain a steady drive toward these goals. 

His reappearance is regarded as a great opportunity by the forces of chaos, especially in the demon-worshipping cleric [[Mordrin]]. In order that he might fully exploit this opportunity, Mordrin has formed a shaky alliance with Sakatha and is busily working to establish a stronghold for his vile faith in the areas near the swamp. 

Evil creatures of many types, including the band of brigands now terrorizing the southern lands of Or, have naturally been drawn to Sakatha's presence. These brigands are of course mere pawns in the hands of Sakatha and Mordrin--the first little ripple of what these two envision as a wave of evil that will sweep over the land of Or.
