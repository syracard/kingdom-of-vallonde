# Districts

## Canal District
*A series of deep, long dried up canals striates the southwestern district of the city. Long ago, the mages who built Cuthbert Castle attempted an irrigation project to increase the yield of the farmlands throughout the region. Now, though, the mages dead and their magics ceased, the canals cut through the city, flooding with the rains and acting as a shantytown of sorts for the poorest of Cadun when the weather is dry.*

### Locations
**[[Wina's Keep]]**
	The ruins of a six-sided keep stand among the dried canals of the district. No one lays claim to them and they provide more substantial shelter to some of the poor than the shanties they construct in the canal beds. The teyrn's soldiers not seem to pay it much heed apart from occasionally sweeping the ruins under the guise of public safety.  
	**DC 15 Streetwise:** *'Streetwise' uses Charisma or Wisdom and you have proficiency if you have a Criminal (or other similar) background.* Speaking with some of the people who have made these ruins their home and are passing through the immediate area, you learn that there is a rumored undercroft of the tower that has been sealed since the tower was leveled by magical destruction. 
	**DC 15 Perception:** As you examine the ruins you recognize that whatever structure this once was was constructed at a central nexus point of the canals. 
	**DC 20 Investigation:** Sifting through some of the rubble after a few mangy-looking folks skitter away from you, you uncover a flagstone beneath some of the impromptu campsites. The markings indicate that it is an entry to some sort of underground complex but it is unclear if this stone was meant to keep looters out, or to keep something in. 
**The Crossed Hammers**
	A dwarven tavern. Probably the only stone structure in this part of the city that isn't in ruins. It is run by Erehrt (He/Him), an auburn haired dwarf. 
	**Notice Board:** The Crossed Hammers notice board has one flyer that catches your eyes. 
		**Baron Brunis' Request:** The baron of Or, John Brunis is requesting aid. Merchant caravans going south from Vendare have reported attacks from bandits and marauders. There is a substantial reward for any group who is able to assist the baron with this matter. 

## Copper Market
*Built around an old pit mine, the Copper Market sits on the southeast corner of the city, sprawling along the coast.*

**DC 15 History:** Speaking with a few locals and doing some research you learn that this section of the city was named for the veins of copper ore present in the city and the hills to the northwest. During the reign of the [[Circle of Cuthbert]] repeated, powerful spellcraft done in the area resulted in a transmutation of the ores from copper to different types of precious gemstones that fueled the craftsmen who eventually formed the [[Sapphire Grove (DM)]]. 

### Locations
**Halfheart's Half-Anvil**
	A small (no pun intended) smithy run by [[Ilfen Halfheart (DM)]]. Sitting on a crate in the smithy is a wicker basket with a fine, wood-carved depiction of Ilfen's son, [[Bryce Halfheart (DM)]]. There are a handful of different coins in the basket. If asked Ilfen will describe how his adventure loving son has been missing for almost four weeks. Ilfen believes that he absconded to the sewers, searching after rumors of treasure.

**Rumors**
	DC 15: Sitting at one of the tables are a group of well-to-do merchants and caravan masters. They're a few drinks in and have started complaining about recent business woes. Up until recently they have managed fruitful trade routes between their bases of operation in Cadun and the Barony of Or. The town of Vendare has been growing and generating a tidy profit for themselves and the traders in the outlands. 
	*That Baron Brunis better get his act together or the Teyrn is gonna send his men out there. Then he'll remember how he earned the name 'The Butcher of Bludmyst'*
