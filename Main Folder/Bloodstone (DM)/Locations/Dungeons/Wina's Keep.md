*Wina's Keep once stood tall and proud in the Canal's District of [[Cadun (DM)]]. That time was long ago, when the mages who founded the city still ruled these lands. Now, it is a ruin, only the walls of the ground floor still standing. Nowadays, the remains of the tower serve as a nexus for the homeless and vagrants who make their homes in the shanytowns of the canals.*
