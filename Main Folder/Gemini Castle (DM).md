Gemini Castle is commanded by the Amethyst Knife, a criminal syndicate that works for the Gemini Blades. 
One of their members, Jutkarr Flingfingers, was killed by the party in the market in Cadun. He'd spotted them and recognized their faces from the bounties that the Blades were pursuing. He was defeated in his attempted capture of them. 
AK have recruited a company of kobolds to man the defenses of the castle and serve as fodder and footsoldiers for their nefarious endeavours.
