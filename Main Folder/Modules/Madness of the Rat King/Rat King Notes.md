# Background
In the sewers underneath [[Cadun (DM)]] an ambitious were-rat alchemist known only as "the Rat King" set up a base of operations years ago. In one of the abandoned, cavernous labs left behind by the [[Circle of Cuthbert]] this creature has been using alchemy and magic to mutate and breed loyal rat minions. To sustain his operations, he sends his rat minions out into the world to collect supplies: from food and drink to other necessary equipment. 

The initial motives for the Rat King's experimentation is a mystery even to himself. At some point during his time in these caverns, a dark influence took hold of him, slowly driving him insane. The Rat King now has once clear goal in his crazed mind: to create an army of mutant rats and take over the surface, to escape and protect the world from what he calls " the Old Voice," a malicious entity that whispers to him endlessly from the deep. 

Unknown to all the current cavern inhabitants is that in ancient times long forgotten, this was a meeting place for a nefarious cult that worshiped [[Cult of the Old Voice|the Old Voice]]. The cultists left the surface world long ago, but dark remnants remain: a shrine here, an altar there. The poor fools that spend too much time near these sinister devices are susceptible to the Old Voice's whispers, inviting them to join it in the deep waters below. 

## Hooks
**Rescue Mission:** 
	[[Bryce Halfheart (DM)]], a restless teen with an adventurer's spirit, has gone missing. His father, a blacksmith named [[Ilfen Halfheart (DM)]], fears that the boy got lost in the sewers after hearing rumors that some sort of treasure might be down there. Ilfen offers 150 gp reward per person and free lodging in the rooms above his shop for his son's safe return. 
**The Armor of Invulnerability:**
	If the PCs succeed on a DC 15 Streetwise check in one of Cadun's bars they overhear some drunken mercenaries talking about the legendary *armor of invulnerability*, once the prized possession of legendary wizard named [[Oswald the Tailor]]. Supposedly it was lost deep within a cavern connected to the sewers under the city. The mercenaries argue over the details of this rumor -- who owned the armor, how strong it really was, how it was lost -- but they all agree that it's somewhere in the cavern. Many have journeyed down into the depths to retrieve the armor, but none have returned. The mercenaries boast that they'll claim the armor for themselves, but right now their too busy drinking, working, and recovering from injuries. 

## Common Features
The caverns are dank, musty, and dirty. Typical sounds include the dripping of water from stalactites, the echoing chitter of rats, and the soft murmur of a stream. As the PCs explore the caverns, they'll discover several recurring features throughout:
	**Lighting:** 
		All areas within the cavern are unlit unless noted otherwise. 
	**Ceilings and Walls:** 
		The natural caverns vary between 10 to 30 feet high. The jagged and uneven walls have many hand and footholds, but they are slick with moisture; climbing the walls in these locations requires a DC 15 Athletics check, and a failure by 5 or more results in a fall. 
	**Tunnels:** 
		The natural tunnels vary between 10 to 15 feet high. 
	**Stalagmites and Stalactites:** 
		of various sizes jut out from the rough natural tunnels, potentially offering cover and hiding spots but not impeding general travel. 

## Random Patrols
The Rat King's lair is infested with his mutant rat minions, and it's possible that a random pack of them will run into the PCs as they explore the caverns. These rat encounters can happen in **areas A, B, D, J, and K**. 

If the PCs are making liberal use of short and long rests between clearing out sections of the dungeon, the Rat King may be alerted of intruders by scouting rats and starts sending out patrols. 

Additionally, if the PCs are looking to control a specific type of mutant rat with a *potion of rat control* but cannot find one in the dungeon it may be a good idea to throw a random patrol at them containing the rat they seek. 

# Chambers and Encounters
## Area A: Cave Entrance
This tunnel is the main entrance into the Rat King's domain. His rat minions bring in the food they forage from outside through here. A DC 10 Perception or Investigation check spots a small trail of food crumbs -- bread, cheese, salted pork -- leading deeper into the cavern in **area B**. 

### Combat
A mix of **giant rats** and **spider rats** guard the entrance. They watch the tunnel from their hiding spots: the giant rats peeking out of holes in the bumpy tunnel walls and the spider rats clinging to stalactites hanging from the ceiling. A DC 14 Perception check spots the giant rats; a DC 18 Perception check spots the spider rats. 

If the spider rats aren't spotted before they attack, read when they strike:
	*A high-pitched hiss alerts you to trouble from above. On the ceiling is an eight-legged, multi-eyed rodent. It bares its needle-like teeth before leaping off the ceiling at you.* 
	5 **Giant Rat**, 5 **Rat Spider** 
		200 xp

## Area B: Storage Room
This open cave room has been carved out from the amin tunnel. All food that has been foraged or stolen by the rats from the outside world is gathered here where they are carefully organized and stored for later distribution. There is a secret door in the northern wall of the chamber. 

*Large musty wooden barrels line the walls of this chamber. Piled atop the barrels or propped beside them are smaller casks of wine and ale. A small leather book sits on one of the barrels, alongside a small glass vial containing a strange liquid.* 

PCs investigating the room can easily find wine, ale, salted pork and beef, dried fruit, nuts, and stale bread. 

### Swinging Axe Trap
A 5-foot square of the cave floor near the entrance has been transformed into a clever pressure plate trap. The cavern inhabitants know to avoid stepping on it. 
**Detecting the Trap:**
	A successful DC 12 Perception check reveals the edges of worked stone along the pressure plate's boundaries. 
**Triggering the Trap:**
	The pressure plate triggers if at least 20 pounds of pressure is placed on it. Once triggered, an axe suspended along the ceiling by ropes is released. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. 

### The Rat King's Journal (#1)
A small leather-bound journal sits on one of the barrels in plain view. This is one of the Rat King's many journals, which he pours his addled thoughts into before he misplaces and forgets it. The chicken-scratch entries are mostly insane ramblings. A DC 12 Investigation check reveals excerpts of important information. 

### Secret Door
A successful DC 15 Investigation check notices a crease in the northern wall. The wall is hinged and can be opened outward by gipping crevices in the wall as makeshift handles, revealing a secret chamber (**area C**). 
## Area C: Secret Chamber
*This small square room is layered thick with dust and cobwebs. Random bits of old clothing are strewn about the floor haphazardly. Staring at you with bulbous eyes is a strange fish-like humanoid statue garbed in priestly robes. At its webbed stone feet lays a pile of coins.*

This cavern was used long ago by cultists of the Old Voice. Back then, the cultists would leave their final earthly possessions in this small room before proceeding down into the waters below. 

The ancient clothing on the floor here is mundane, moldy, and covered in dust. 

The surface of of the statue secretes a thin layer of of dark mucous. The pile of treasure at its feet contains 400 cp, 160 sp, 8 gp, and a citrine gemstone (10 gp). 

Within the pockets of one of the discarded robes is a medallion (15 gp) that oddly shimmers in the dark. Anyone staring at the medallion intently begins to have a nagging sensation of unease. 
## Area D: Cavern Crossroad
The main tunnel exapnds into a large chamber that divides into three more tunnels heading southwest, south, and north. A subteranean stream spills into the chamber through the northeast and continues down the southern tunnel. 
### The Stream
The stream that winds its way through the complex is shallow, averaging 1/2 to 2 ft in depth. The cavern floor beneath the stream is coated with slick layers of moss and algae. PCs moving at a normal walking speed will be able to avoid slipping. PCs moving quickly, such as running around in combat, must make a DC 10 Dexterity check to avoid slipping. On a fail:
	1. Determine their movement (i.e. the number of squares). 
	2. Randomly determine at which square they fall prone. 
### The Alarm
The Rat King has cast an *alarm* spell on the northern entrance of this chamber to alert his minions of any intruders. Characters detecting magic notice a faint aura of abjuration. As soon as any Medium-sized humanoid passes through the northern exit, the sound of a hand bell begins to ring loudly for 10 seconds, alerting nearby rats and initiating combat. 
### Combat
If the *alarm* is triggered, nearby rats arrive from the north and southwest tunnels: 4 Explodey Rats, 3 Blue Dragon Rats, and 3 Laser Rats
### Treasure Above
A satchel is hidden inside a small cavity in the cave ceiling. The PCs can spot the satchel with a DC 14 Perception or Investigation check. The satchel contains 30 gp, a long golden bracelet with a rippled batter that shines ruby-red in torchlight (100gp), and a small packet containing *dust of dryness*. 
## Area E: Fungus Room
*A forest of fungi covers the cavern here. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, some squatting down to the floor and wiggling strange appendages, others towering up to 20 or more feet into the air and pugging out golden glittery spores every so often. Orbs of violet light shine from the walls and ceiling, casting a lavender glow on the area.*

A variety of fungi grow in these chamber, bathed in a dim purple light. The Rat King collects many alchemical ingredients from this area, using a rat-bear-pig's keen smell to avoid the violet fungus hiding here. 

The orbs of violet light are **giant fire beetles**. Eating these local mushrooms has changed their typical reddish orange glow to violet. Their glow illuminates the entire chamber with dim light. The beetles aren't hostile to the PCs, and if attacked they'd rather flee than fight. 

A PC examining the various fungi growing here can make a Nature check (DC 12). On a success they identify the fungi yellow puffball and weeping wig, which are used for multiple alchemical brews, including potions of rat control. 
### Combat
8 **violet fungus** hide amongst the other fungi. Place them spread throughout the area. While motionless, they are indistinguishable from the surrounding fungi. A violet fungus attacks once a PC wanders within its range. 

**Sniffing Out Trouble:** Although the violet fungi are nearly impossible to detect visually from their benign surroundings, there are ways for the PCs to avoid walking into their slithering embrace. One way is to control a rat-bear-pig with a *potion of rat control* and have it identify the violet fungi at a safe distance with its keen smell. 
## Area F: Altar of Forbidden Power
*A shallow pool of water covers the floor of this small round chamber. Floating serenely atop the water's surface are two large dark purple lotuses, whose seed pods glow faintly in the darkness. Standing at the center of the room is a stone statue of a fish-like humanoid garbed in priestly robes, its entire surface glistening with a thin blackish mucous. Held in its outstretched webbed hands is a ceremonial bowl filled with a dark purplish liquid.*
*As you enter the room, a primal thought beings to throb in your head persistently. The thought coalesces into a message, a command, growing more enticing and horrible with every repetition. It says, "Mix the blood. Take the power."*

Tucked at the end of the fungus chamber is another altar dedicated to the entity known as the Old Voice. The creature's corrupting influence still manifests here, tempting mortals with power. 

Characters inside the room will find their hearing severely dampened, unable to hear anything but the loudest sounds as faint echoes, their minds preoccupied with the message repeating in their heads. A PC's hearing gradually returns to normal and the thought disappears after about a minute once they have left the room. 
### Black Lotus
The two black lotuses float on the water's surface. These incredibly rare flowers are currently in full bloom. Tiny, delicate wisps of raw magic dance off the glowing seed pods, dissipating into the air. The lotuses both blossomed earlier today and will die in a few hours. 

While the market for black lotuses is very small -- most people haven't even heard of them, and others know only half-remembered legends -- there are powerful and wealthy individuals that would happily pay hundreds of gold for even a withered black lotus seed pod. 

The demon door in **area L** will open if a player places one of these black lotuses inside it. 
### Offer From the Deep
The fish-like humanoid statue is slick with a thin blackish mucous. Its bulbous, lidless eyes seem to follow the PCs in the room and have a flicker of malevolent intelligence to them. 

The bowl carries a purplish liquid that smells of blood but doesn't congeal. Any PC staring at the bowl innately (and oddly) understands that the alien though in their head want them to add their own blood to the bowl. A PC that willingly adds some of their own blood to the bowl becomes cursed with the *[[Mark of the Deep]]* 
## Area G: Flooded Tunnel

*A stream covers this tunnel's floor, rushing southward over slick rocks before dropping off into the abyss. Rising up from the bubbling waters at the edge of the falls is a sinister stone altar.*
*A smaller, dry tunnel branches off from the main flooded tunnel. The skeletal remains of a humanoid can be spotted near the entrance.*
### The Stream
The stream from **Area D** is flowing faster at this point and averaging 2 to 3 1/2 ft in depth. The cavern floor beneath the stream is overgrown with mossy sludge. As a result, wading through the stream here counts as difficult terrain and PCs moving quickly (such as running in combat) must make a DC 12 Dexterity check to avoid slipping. 
### Shiny Ring
Characters may spot a simple gold ring gleaming in the water. This is a *ring of alertness*. 
### Combat
#### Checks
Perception:
	16: Notice the black pudding "rock's" lack of moss.
	18: Notice the skeletons (8) littering the stream. 
Nature: 
	12: Identify the "rock" as a black pudding.

Dangers lurk here in the waters: a **black pudding** and **skeletons** lay motionless at the bottom of the stream, waiting for living prey to devour. The skeletons are covered in a thick layer of moss at the bottom of the stream, requiring a PC to succeed on a DC 18 Perception check to notice them. 

While motionless, the black pudding is nearly indistinguishable from one of the many wet rocks that make up the stream's floor, save for one feature: unlike most other rocks, no moss grows on the ooze. A PC must succeed on a DC 16 Perception check to notice this oddity.

*You hear the clattering of bones and the splash of water as moss-covered skeletons rise from the stream. Your gaze shifts from their rusted scimitars to an even stranger sight: an oily pool slithers atop the water toward you, rising to strike like a liquid snake.*
### Altar of the False God
A crumbling altar of blackened stone looms over the precipice of the falls. The base of the altar has been carved to resemble a pile of pones. Its flat top is stained red with old blood. 

PCs carefully searching the altar can find a small hidden compartment in the altar by succeeding on a DC 14 Investigation check. Inside is a dagger with a wicked twisting blade glistening with black ichor; a *dagger of sacrifice*. 
### Secret Tunnel Entrance
The pile of stone rubble at the edge of the falls hides the entrance to a tunnel to **Area H**. PCs inspecting the area can find the tunnel by succeeding on a DC 12 Investigation check. 
### Falling to Doom
The stream ends at the southern point of the tunnel, dropping down an unknown distance into the darkness below. 
## Area H: Unused Tunnel
This tunnel connects the southern end of the flooded tunnel (**Area G**) with the Rat King's laboratory (**Area N**). The exit to the flooded tunnel is sealed off with stone rubble and debris that has sat here undisturbed for ages. The seemingly dead end can be pushed aside to revel the tunnel entrance. 

The Rat King is  convinced that the tunnel leads to a dead end and makes no effort to keep watch for intruders emerging from it. A quiet PC approaching the lab from the tunnel without a light source could potentially catch him unaware. 
## Area I: Storm's Rest
Resting at the end of this chamber is *Storm's Herald*, a magical warhammer of great renown. The faint humming it emits has drawn a colony of darkmantles to the area. 

*The skeletal remains of a robed humanoid leans against the wall at the entrance of this chamber, its bony hand clutching a yellowed piece of paper and a lantern by its side. The entire ceiling of this chasm drips downward with hundreds of stalactites of various sizes at the end of the chamber, laying on a raised platform, is an exquisite warhammer that glows blue in the darkness and emits a faint humming noise that reverberates softly throughout the chamber.* 

### Esmer's Remains
The skeleton at the entrance of this chamber was once an elven wizard named Esmer. Long ago, she led a party of adventurers in search of *Storm's Herald*. Esmer, along with the remainder of her party, met their end here when they were ambushed by the darkmantles in the chamber. The wizard managed to drag herself to the chamber's entrance and write a final message before succumbing to her wounds. 

PCs searching through the skeleton's robes will find a small pouch containing 15 gp, along with a spellbook that clearly suffered heavy water damage. Most of the pages are stuck together and the ink is smeared or washed away completely. A PC searching for anything legible must succeed on a DC 10 Investigation check to find the following spells intact: *darkvision*, *detect magic*, and *grease*. 

The hooded lantern beside the skeleton is in oddly pristine condition. The lanterns' iron casing is flecked with a shimmering silver that mirrors a star-filled night sky. It is a *lantern of revealing*. 

Clutched in the skeleton's hand is a note written on the back of a *scroll of silence*. 
## Area J: Breeding Chamber
The Rat King uses this room to breed more of his mutant rats. He has left his right-hand rat, Nibbles, to oversee operations here while he works in the laboratory. 

*Rows of long wood tables hog most of the space in this filthy room. Dozens of metal cages sit atop the tables, most containing rats of all shapes and sizes. The air is filled with the sound of chittering and the fouls smell of rat droppings.*

*As you approach the entrance a voice squeaks in your head, "Stay your weapons! Nibbles wishes to speak with you. Perhaps we can help each other out?"*
