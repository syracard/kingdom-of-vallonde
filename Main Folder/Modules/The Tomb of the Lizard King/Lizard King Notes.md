*Adaptation of the Tomb of the Lizard King* by Mark Acres

# Introduction
For many years there has been peace in the lands of [[Baron John Brunis (DM)]], John Brunis. The fertile plain of the River Ardo has yielded bountifully, commerce has prospered, and the rule of the successive barons has been generally wise and just. But of late, disturbing reports of highway robbery have reached the palace at [[Vendare (DM)]], the major city of Or. According to the tales of whimpering merchants, the southlands are being overrun by a band of vicious brigands. Already there has been a complete halt to the rich trade caravans to and from Or's southern neighbors.

Three weeks ago Baron Brunis sent a squad of 30 warriors to the affected area near the small village of [[Waycombe (DM)]]. So far there has been no report, no message, no rider â€” not even a rumor of their fate. Suddenly gravely concerned, the baron has called for a special group of volunteers to go to the Waycombe area, discover the fate of the first expedition, investigate the reports of highway robbery, and if possible put an end to this trouble. Those who answer his call can expect danger, but also great reward, for the baron is known as a generous man who rewards his loyal subjects well. 

# The Palace of the Count of Or
## 1. A Private Meeting
*Hearing of the baron's need, your party has responded. Brigands usually manage to accumulate a good deal of treasure, and they usually aren't particularly tough to handle. These brigands, however, may be tougher than usual, for as you sit waiting outside the baron's audience chamber, you see a succession of seasoned adventurers and mercenaries enter full of enthusiasm, only to leave shortly with looks of disappointment and fear.*

*As you sit pondering this strange situation, the door to the audience chamber swings open and the chamberlain announces that it is now your party's turn to meet the baron of Or.*

*As you enter, you see John Brunis, fifth baron of Or, seated comfortably on a high seat at the end of a long table. Standing behind him, resplendent in his robes of bright yellow and blue, is [[Jorlon]], the High Priest of Vendare, a man who commands a large following among the people of Or. In his right hand Jorlon holds a slim, tapered wand of ivory. The tip of this wand is made of beryl.* 
	Beryl is a sky-blue mineral. 

*The room itself is richly but tastefully appointed with curtains, tapestries, and other objects of value.*

*"Welcome, courageous volunteers!" the count says to you. "I assume you understand the nature of the task at hand?"*

Brunis will question the party members about their experiences, previous adventures, and skill in dealing with danger. He will then simply chat for a while, apparently trying to get some idea o the nature of the party. Jorlon will stand quietly, seeming to be almost asleep on his feet and taking no notice of the conversation. In fact, the wand in his hand is a **wand of enemy detection** that he has already used to determine the party is not immediately hostile. He is now quietly performing an **augury**, using several small beads hidden in his left hand. The hand is covered by the sleeves and folds of his robe. 

After three of four minutes, Jorlon will look directly at John Brunis and nod his head once slowly. Brunis will now become very businesslike. He says:

*"You are accepted for this task. What you must do seems simple. Travel to the village of Waycombe in the south. Learn the fate of my soldiers; they were led by [[Barto Trume]], one of my most trusted lieutenants. Then find these detestable brigands and eliminate them; summary justice is approved by my authority. Above all else, find out if there is any further evil behind these vicious attacks. If so, eliminate it. Your reward for success will be whatever you regain from the evil you discover, plus my personal gratitude.*

To the best of his ability, the count will answer any questions the party may have at this time. He will agree to cover the costs of outfitting the party with any unusual or costly items they desire, as long as their demands do not exceed 2500gp worth of merchandise. If the party members ask whether the count has reason to believe there is more Waycombe than mere brigands, he will simply glance at Jorlon, smile, and say, "So I have been told." Jorlon will say nothing, even if directly questioned.

The baron will then suggest that the party come into the main council room where merchants have assembled to give their firsthand reports to the party selected to deal with the brigands. 

## 2. The Merchants' Complaints
*The baron leads you into the large chamber used for public audiences. He sits behind the center of a long table, facing the crowd in the room, and gestures for you to take seats on either side of him. Jorlon, silent as ever, stands behind the baron.*

*The audience chamber is filled with merchants. Their chattering has been hushed by the count's entrance. Scattered about the room are a few men clad in armor, obviously mercenary guards. The two large doors at the rear of the chamber are manned by guards in the baron's livery. In each corner behind you, you notice a cleric in yellow and blue robes. Both are standing quietly with their heads lowered, occasionally muttering a soft word of devotion to themselves or to their deity.*

In addition to the party, Baron Brunis, and Jorlon, the following people are in the room:
	23 Merchants who are unarmored and unarmed.
	6 Mercenary Guards who have been disarmed before being allowed in the audience hall.
	2 Clerics who are without armor or weapons.

The baron will introduce the party to this assembly, then ask the merchants to give what information they can to the party. The result will be a babble of wailing, moaning, and groaning over goods and treasure lost, guards killed, captured or fled, and so forth. In fact, the din will become so unmanageable that the baron will order silence, and suggest that the party question the merchants, rather than letting them all speak freely. 

All of the merchants in the room are involved in the caravan trade with Or's southern neighbors. Some are honest, a few are not, but none are in league with the brigands. All have suffered losses from the brigand raids. in answer to specific questions from party members, the merchants will provide the following information:
1. The attacks by the brigands almost always occur along the main highway near Waycombe and [[the Great Southern Swamp]].
2. The brigands always seem to come from the south.
3. The brigands look like humans.
4. The merchants believe the brigands to be very tough fighters. Their mercenary guards have been ineffective against the brigands; most of the guards seem to flee the instant the attacks begin. 
5. The brigands actively pursue the fleeing guards. The merchants believe that many have been taken prisoner.
6. The brigand attacks are always preceded by the appearance of a harmless-looking little old man who stops the head of the merchants' columns to ask for directions.

If the party questions any of the fighters present, they will be able to add that only a few brigands appear to be really tough fighters; most of the brigands choose to pursue the panic-stricken guards who flee when the attacks begin. So far, none of the guards have been able to take a brigand prisoner; indeed, they are usually lucky to escape with their lives. There is usually great confusion during the brigand attacks, so the number of brigands is hard to estimate.

Note that the only way that the party may obtain this information is by careful questioning. 

While the party is questioning the merchants and their guards, secretly roll saves vs. [[Sakatha]]'s **scrying** spell. Sakatha is using a crystal ball to keep track of happenings in the baron's palace. Any character who succeeds on their save should be informed that they "have a strong feeling that someone is watching the party."

The Dungeon Master should also occasionally remind the party of the presence of the clerics in the corners behind them. The Dungeon Master should do this by saying, every few minutes, "And of course you hear the clerics in the background saying 'May the powers of good protect this place and all herein' and other things of this sort."

Any character who keeps a careful watch on these clerics will notice that after a few minutes one of them leaves and is replaced by another from outside the room. This is a scheduled routine relief; Brunis and Jorlon will take no notice of it. The replacement cleric is dressed identically to the first one and will behave in exactly the same way. However, he is in fact the chaotic evil [[Mordrin|High Priest Mordrin]], an ally of Sakatha. 

Mordrin is wearing chainmail beneath his robes, and is armed with a mace. He is carrying two packets of **dust of disappearance**. 

After rolling for the detection of *Scrying* and giving any successful character a chance to take action, the DM should resume playing the role of the merchants, and continue to mimic occasionally the chanting of the clerics. The third time he repeats the chanting, the DM should say, "Oh great power of evil, destroy now thine enemies..." The DM should then count to five out loud. Any characters still within ten feet of the count's table when the DM reaches "five" will be caught in the *Flame Strike* that has just been cast by Mordrin. 

Any character who reacts in time to avoid the *Flame Strike* will also have been able to spot the cleric who cast it. The other characters will not realize for one melee round exactly what has happened. 

Mordrin had hoped to kill Baron Brunis with this *Flame Strike*. After casting it, he will attempt to escape, using his robes as a disguise. The merchants, mercenary guards, and baron's guards present will all be too stunned to react swiftly; if Mordrin is to be stopped, he must be stopped by the party. Mordrin's preferred plan is to cast *Sanctuary* on himself, then duck out of the room and use his **dust of disappearance**.

The DM may modify this plan as the situation requires; however, it is very important that every effort be made to allow Mordrin to escape. The DM should assume that once Mordrin makes it outside the palace gates, he has effectively escaped. 

In the unlikely event that Mordrin is captured, he will resist all attempts at interrogation, will attempt to escape by any means possible, and will prefer death to giving information to the count or the party.  It is vitally important that the party not learn the secret of Sakatha's reappearance at this time. 

Meanwhile, the DM should note that, even if the party attempts to warn them before the flames hit, both John Brunis and Jorlon will be caught in the *Flame Strike*. 

## 3. Aftermath
Following the attack by Mordrin, the baron will urge the party to make all possible speed on their mission, for he no "fears the worst" and feels that "quick, decisive action is vitally important." More than this he will not willingly say. If compelled to speak by some magic means, he will share his fears about vague legends he has heard concerning the Great Lizard King Sakatha, who once dwelled in the Great Southern Swamp. According to legends, this horrid being is to return someday to take vengeance on the house of the Barons of Or. 

If one or more party members were killed by Mordrin's *Flame Strike*, Jorlon will agree to cast *Raise Dead*, provided the party agrees to swear an oath to perform their mission for the baron. 

The party may purchase any type of normal equipment in Vendare. Information, however, will be harder to find. The only knowledge available in the city is the fact that peasants in the south are reputed to know many legends about lizardfolk who lived in the Great Southern Swamp a very long time ago. 

Some parties will insist upon outfitting a fake merchant's caravan to make the trip to the south. John Brunis will strongly advise against this plan, citing the dangers of both delay in preparation and of surprise attack. An extremely insistent party will be able to persuade the baron to bear the expenses of outfitting such an expedition. The baron will agree to pay for twenty mercenary guards. These guards will not fight, however, unless it is absolutely necessary in order to save their own lives. They will give up accompanying the party when they reach Waycombe. 

# The Journey to Waycombe

The DM may show the party the hex map of Or, and allow the party to use it when planning and making their journey to the Waycombe area. The rate of travel on the highways or through the countryside will be forty miles (eight hexes) per day for a party mounted on average horses, or half that rate for a party on foot. food and shelter are readily available at the inns marked along the way, and from peasants in the villages on the map. 

Sakatha will attempt to **scry** the party once per night, at about midnight, from now until the party reaches the temple in the swamp. The DM should roll a secret check for each character each night at midnight to see if this **scrying** is detected. If the **scrying** is detected, the DM should simply tell the character that he or she feels as if someone is watching them. 

There are **random** and **planned** encounters on the way to Waycombe.

## Random Encounters
The DM should check for a random encounter three times per day during the journey to the Waycombe area. Rolling a 1 on a d12 means there's an encounter. When a random encounter is called for, roll on the Random Encounter Table. Each encounter should only occur once. 

| D10 | Encounter   |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | T-Rex       |
| 2   | Giant Ants  |
| 3   | Refugees    |
| 4   | Stragglers  |
| 5   | Hill Giants |
| 6   | Ogres       |
| 7   | Wolves      |
| 8   | Lizard Men  |
| 9   | Old Man     |
| 10  | Clerics     |
### 1. T-Rex
1 T-Rex chasing 5 farmers. (780xp)

The farmers are from the area are being chased by the T-Rex. They have little information to offer, but will be glad to give food and shelter for the night in return for the party's aid with the T-Rex. Each farmer has a wife and 1-4 children. The only treasure they possess is 1-10 gp kept in their homes. 

These farmers will have heard some rumors about the brigandage. If the encounter takes place within one day's journey of Waycombe, the farmers will be fearful for their own safety and discussing the possibility of leaving the area before they, too, are attacked by the brigands. 
### 2. Giant Ants
### 3. Refugees
A group of about 12 adults and 13 children. 

These peasant refugees from the Waycombe area. They look tired and hungry. Their goal is to reach Vendare in hope of finding food, shelter, and aid from the baron. 

If questioned by the party, the refugees will tell of crops ruined, friends stolen away from their homes in the middle of the night, and murder and vandalism by a band of brigands. They will also tell the party wild tales of "terrible things" that come in the night along with the brigands. These "terrible things" will be described in a number of ways: some of the men will say that they appear human; others will say not; some will say they fly; others will say they don't.

The refugees have no treasure. 
### 4. Stragglers
4 soldiers.

These four haggard-looking men are wearing the colors of the Baron of Or.  They are stragglers from the original party of 30 and were among the first to run when the fighting began. If the party is displaying anything that would identify them as being in the service of the Baron, these stragglers will attempt to avoid them. If not, they will approach the party cautiously. 

All four men feel ashamed for having run away at the start of the fight, but are also afraid of being punished, and thus will attempt to conceal what really happened. At first, they will say only that they are soldiers in the service of the baron, and that their business is their own. If compelled to speak truthfully, they will admit that they were part of the troop sent to Waycombe. They will tell the players that when the troop stopped to give directions to a little old man, thy were suddenly attacked by brigands hiding in the bushes near the road. These four, along with many others, fled immediately, although they are not sure why they were so scared at the time. 

These men will not want to aid the party. If compelled to serve, they will desert at the first opportunity. They have no treasure other than their weapons and armor. 
### 5. Hill Giants
3 Hill Giants (360 xp)

These three fine fellows are wandering the plains in search of loot, food, and fun. They will choose to avoid a heavily armed party or caravan, but will attack the party on sight. The giants know nothing about the activity of the brigands in the Waycombe area. They know nothing about the baron's men. 
#### Treasure
Bag of 100gp, looted from a merchant who was fleeing a brigand attack. 
### 6. Ogres
Ogre Chain Brute x3 and Ogre Battering Ram x2 (540xp)

These ogres have been attracted to the area by the general devastation caused by the brigands. They will attempt to ambush the party, attacking by leaping from the scrub bush along the road. They have no information useful to the party. 
#### Treasure
250gp
### 7. Wolves
### 8. Lizard Men
12 Lizardfolk (720xp)

This is a roving band of lizardfolk from the Great Southern Swamp that surrounds the Tomb of the Lizard King. The fact that they are openly roaming this far from the swamp should be a sure indication to an intelligent party of the nature of the real trouble at Waycombe!

These warriors will be extremely confident and extremely hostile to the party, attacking immediately unless the party consists of more than 12 members. In combat the Lizardfolk will do everything possible to take prisoners. These prisoners will be taken to Sakatha, and will be used as sacrifices by his demon worshipping allies. On the way to Sakatha's fortress, there will be no chance to escape: players will be tightly bound and closely watched. Upon arriving at the tomb, they will be kept in **Room 16** of the **Lower Temple**, where they will be bed once a day for the week until they will be brought before Sakatha, tortured, then sacrificed. Their chances will be slim if they can find a way to escape: unarmed in the heart of the Lizard King's dungeon!
### 9. Old Man
1 Old Man

An old man in tattered clothing will approach the party, using the main road. He will ask directions to Vendare, saying that he is trying to find some relatives who fled Waycombe. This old man is completely harmless. He has no treasure or information. 

(This is a very funny bit). 
### 10. Clerics
4 Human Clerics: Achmar, Merloc, Almor, and Durmil. Achmar is mounted on a warhorse. 

These four clerics have been working with the peasants in the countryside. All are dressed in the yellow and blue robes of Jorlon's sect. If treated in a friendly manner, they can give the party the following information: 
1. They have been near Waycombe. There is a rumor there that the baron's soldiers were attacked and either killed or scattered by a band of brigands. 
2. Superstitious stores are circulating among the peasants. They are tales o horrible flying things that come in the night and carry people away. Other stories tell of some sinister power in the Great Southern Swamp. Worst of all, from the clerics' point of view, there are vague stories of demon worship among some of the peasants. 
3. Many of the peasants are becoming terrified as the brigand raids and superstitious stories spread. Several have already left their lands and possessions to seek safety in Vendare. 
4. The clerics themselves do not believe most of the superstitious tales, but feel that many of them are the usual types of rumors spread when there is trouble in the area. 

## Planned Encounters
These encounters will occur automatically if and when the party reaches the appropriate area on the way to Waycombe. 
### 1. The Robin's Breast Inn
*As you step inside the roadside inn, you immediately notice that there are only 15 customers in a tavern room that supposedly is usually packed with travelers. Most of the customers appear to be local farmers or artisans. There are absolutely no merchants.*

*The portly, middle-aged innkeeper is standing behind his bar. As you enter, he perks up a bit and calls out, "Greetings to you, good travelers! What might be your pleasure?"*

*As you complete your survey of the room, you can see that there is only one fellow of note: a long, lanky man clad in leather jerkin and green, sitting alone in a corner. He is softly plucking on a stringed instrument.*

The man with the instrument may look like a bard, but is in fact just a wandering minstrel named [[Pluck]]. His only weapon is a small dagger. 

The innkeeper is [[William Brightboy]]. He is not armored, but keeps both an old sword and wooden staff handy behind his bar. He seldom uses either. 

Pluck will approach the party and offer to sing a song or two in exchange for a few pieces of silver. If specifically asked about local peasant lore or stories, he will offer to perform "[The Ballad of Sakatha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohopWhwDVUo)." This will immediately disturb the other customers in teh inn, who will make angry comments such as, "Let evil lie sleeping, you fool!" and "Why invite more trouble? Stick with your silly songs and leave us in peace."

Pluck will still sing the ballad, despite the customers' displeasure, provided the party can pacify Brightboy, who will also be very upset (only because his customers are upset). If Pluck sings the ballad, they will hear the following lyric: 

Sakatha once was the Great Lizard King,
Said to have power stored in a ring. 
O'er swamplands and plains lands his dominions they spread; 
His very name filled all creatures with dread. 

To build his great tomb in the midst of the marsh,
Many died in slavery most harsh.
His minions took all of our best for his altar; 
Not for a day did his bloody thirst falter. 

Then there arose the great Count or Or,
The greatest of heroes in those days of yore; 
He slew Sakatha in the Battle of Waycombe; 
The Lizard Men carried their slaughtered chief home.

And now he awaits in the cold sleep of death
His day of awakening, his first newborn breath.
Though deep in the ground his followers closed him,
He'll come back for vengeance on those who opposed him.

Following Pluck's performance there will be a long, dead silence in the inn. The minstrel will try to break it, saying, "Come now, good people. This is naught but a ballad used to frighten naughty children at night. Have you all been naughty children?"

His attempts at good cheer will fail, and the customers will silently and sullenly being to file out of the inn. If stopped or questioned they will say only that they have business to attend to at home. Brightboy will be extremely upset, and will need another small tip (a few gold pieces) to stop his whining and complaining. 
#### Treasure:
Pluck has 23 gp and 42 sp on his person. Brightboy has a bag of 155 gp tucked away in a small locked box beneath the bar. Loose money, totaling 12 gp, is on the tables and bar. 
### 2. Ambush at the Great Bridge
*You have come to a place where the road runs right alongside the River Ardo. In the distance, about 300 yards ahead, you can see the bridge where the river curves and crosses under the road. The banks of the road on the riverside are covered with a rich growth of water reeds.*

Lurking in the river and weeds, ready to ambush the party are 6 Lizardfolk, 3 Bloodeyes, and 2 Terrorsoars (2490xp)

This group has been sent by Sakatha to ambush the party. Remember, Sakatha has **scried** the baron's palace, and knows that a party will be coming. The lizardfolk will attack as soon as the party  is in the center of the bridge. Some will rush from both ends of the bridge at once, while others climb over its sides. The bridge is made of stone. It is 120 yards across and 30 feet wide. 
### 3. The Great Split Oak
*About 100 yards ahead on the right side of the road you see a large oak tree split long ago by lightning. A human figure, apparently asleep, is reclining against the trunk of this tree.*

The figure is [[Barto Trume]]. He is wearing battered chainmail and is carrying a shield and his longsword. He is clearly wearing the colors of the Barony of Or. 

As the party approaches, Trume will stir from his sleep. When seen from a close distance, he will appear haggard, thin, tired, and hungry. 

Trume will seek to identify the party, and will act as though he is greatly relieved if he learns that the party is working for the Baron. When questioned, Trume will say that his men were attacked by brigands, and that the entire troop was either scattered, captured, or slain. He will tell the party that the attack began when a little old man approached the head of his column and asked directions. The next thing he knew, his men were fleeing in panic, brigands were pouring out of the fields nearby, and he was deeply involved in a battle. Trume himself was taken prisoner along with four others. He alone has managed to escape and has come this far on foot. 

Trume will tell the party that the brigands' base is in a small copse near a large filed behind the inn at Waycombe. He will say that he counted 40 brigands in all, plus one man who seemed to be some sort of cleric. 

Trume is lying to the party. He has been charmed by Sakatha, and is being sent back to Vendare as an agent of the Lizard King. If the charm is broken, Trume will come to himself and tell the party as much of the truth as he can remember.

1. His troop was attacked by a band of brigands. The little old man who stopped them was obviously, thinking back on it, a magic user--"a dark cleric or some other fell priest most like". 
2. Most of his men were killed or taken prisoner.
3. Trume was knocked unconscious and taken somewhere deep in the Great Southern Swamp. Some terrible evil lurks there, although he cannot remember what it is. 
Trume will insist that his first duty is to return to Vendare and report to the baron. (He will insist on this whether the charm is broken or not.) He will agree to send back as much aid as possible if the party will continue with their mission. The DM should note that in no case will this aid arrive in time to assist the party in the dungeon. If the party waits for such aid, 20 fighters, led by Trume, will eventually meet them near Waycombe, but they will refuse to venture into the Great Southern Swamp. 
# The Village of Waycombe
The village of Waycombe lies in a shallow depression on the north side of the highway. To the south, the ground slopes sharply down to the edges of the Great Southern Swamp. 

Waycombe has always been known as a prosperous peasant village, but its appearance now tells you immediately that this is no longer the case. From the upper edge of the slope you can see some 28 peasants' huts scattered in clusters on both sides of the road. All but five of these have been burned down. The fields, which should be filled with crops and farmers tending those crops, contain nothing but blackened stubble. 

The only building of note is a large wooden structure facing the main highway. Behind it is a large field, and near the field stands a good-sized copse. There are no signs of human inhabitation to be seen from the distance.

## 1. The Copse
The copse is empty, except for the trees and insects that should normally be found there. 
## 2. The Huts
All but five of the peasant huts have been burned. These obviously have been striped of all their contents.
## 3. The Inn
*As you enter this inn, you notice at once that the tavern room has been stripped of furniture. Only a few mugs are on the shelves behind the main bar, and only a few bottles of wine are left there. As you are looking around, the innkeeper enters from the kitchen area, carrying a large sack and several pieces of cloth. He spots you, looks alarmed, and shouts "What's this? Who are you? What do you want?"*

The innkeeper is a fat, grubby fellow named [[Busby]] whose only weapon is a small dagger. The party has interrupted him late in the act of packing his belongings. All that he owns is piled into a wagon in the shed behind the main building. 

If the party is friendly, Busby will offer them the six bottles of wine remaining on his shelves as he packs up the last mugs, wrapping them carefully in the pieces of cloth. He will willingly talk with the party, and with much rambling will give them the following information:

1. The first brigand raids began about three months ago. 
2. The raids have increased in frequency and intensity in the last several weeks. 
3. The brigands have burned most of the village.
4. The brigands usually strike at night. During their night raids, they have carried off many villagers as prisoners: men, women, and children. 
5. Most people flee in panic when the brigands attack. 
6. There have been other strange things going on, about which it is best not to talk. If pressed, Busby will admit to seeing a large, strangely-shaped beast plying over the village at night. There have been tales among some of the villagers about the lizardfolk returning to their old lands in the Great Southern Swamp. 
7. He is the last inhabitant of the village, and he is leaving as soon as his packing is finished. His family and hired hands have already left, heading south toward [[Dragon Canyon]] where they have relatives. 
8. There is one old man who lives in a hut by the edge of the Great Southern Swamp. This old man will not leave, but everyone knows that he is hopelessly insane. 

Nothing the party says or does will persuade Busby to stay or to offer the party any further assistance. 

**Treasure:** Busby's only treasure is in his wagon. It consists of the furniture and dishes for the inn, plus a sack of 200 gp. 
## 4. Stephen DeManis
*As you approach the tiny hut by the edge of the Great Southern Swamp, you hear a singsong chanting coming from inside. You also see smoke rising from a hole in the roof of the hut, a sure sign that there is a fire inside.*

This is the hut of [[Stephen DeManis]], the old man referred to by Busby as hopelessly insane. DeManis is unarmored and only armed with a large knife. 

DeManis is a hermit, but not by choice. He adopted his current lifestyle when the villagers would no longer tolerate his eccentric ways. Now, rather than face constant ridicule, he lives alone in this hut, venturing out only to fish or hunt. He wears tattered green rags, has wildly flying white hair, and his general appearance is offensive. 

As the party approaches, they will hear him chanting a singsong verse: 

*They all thinks I'm crazy, so crazy I am;*
*But I'll sill be here when they ain't what they am!*
*They'll all be taken to Sakatha's lair,*
*But me I'll be free as a bird in the air!*

One day old Stephen ventured a little too far out into the swamp on a hunting trip, and was captured. He was taken to Sakatha, placed under the vampire Lizard King's powerful charm, and used for a while as a spy in the village area. Now his usefulness to Sakatha has ended, but the charm has never been broken. 

In addition to everything else, Stephen DeManis really is insane. He constantly says things like "I wonder why the snakes in my hair will never comb it?" and "Where have all the pretty buggies gone? There are only ugly bugs now. It is a pity."

If treated with kindness, Stephen will weave statements about Sakatha into this type of nonsensical, mad conversation. The player characters will of course never be sure if Stephen knows what he's talking about, or if there is any truth at all to what he says. The true statements Stephen will make about Sakatha are:

1. Sakatha the Great Lizard King has returned.
2. Sakatha is planning to renew his kingdom. 
3. Sakatha is not dead. 
4. Sakatha lives in a great temple in the heart of the swamp. 

If the party expresses interest in Sakatha, Stephen will offer to take them to him on his raft. 

**Treasure:** Stephen has 25 gp tucked away in a sack. The sack is hidden beneath a loose board in the floor of his hut. 
## 5. Special Encounter: The Copse at Night
It is possible that a party deceived by Barto Trume's story might attempt to stake out the copse behind the inn. If so, the following encounter will take place the first night of the stakeout.

*As you carefully watch, you see two figures making their way across the meadow in the dark of the night. They appear to be clad in leather armor, and they are carrying shields and spears. As they reach the center of the meadow, they stop, turn in your direction, and begin to shout: "Death to the Baron of Or! Death to the weakling, stupid, city rats he sends against us!* 

The two figures are brigands. They are bait, attempting to draw the party out into the meadow. This is part of a trap laid by Sakatha to destroy the party. 

Note that if the party is invisible or otherwise magically hidden, the brigands will not be able to turn and look in the party's direction. They will, however, stand in the center of the meadow and shout insults, challenging the party to come out and fight like men. The brigands know that the party is somewhere near because of Sakatha's **scrying**. 

If the party does not seem to move toward the brigands within one turn, the brigands will appear to lose interest and move toward the copse. Nothing more will happen. 

If the party move into the meadow within ten minutes, the DM should allow them to get to the middle of the meadow while the brigands flee towards the copse. 

*You see a large, dark, winged reptilian shape fly across the night sky and then begin to dive toward you.*

The reptilian shape is the Black Dragon, Aulicus. He will attack from the air. He will prefer to use his breath weapon and spells, avoiding melee until the party is weakened. He is a tough, experienced dragon who will attempt to neutralize the party's magic users first, then go after the rest.

Aulicus has been sent by Sakatha to destroy the party. He likes Sakatha, and Sakatha has been providing him with a good lair, lots of treasure, and regular easy meals. Thus, Aulicus will not be inclined to parley and will consider only the very largest of bribes. 

If at any time it appears that the encounter is going against Aulicus, he will fly away, heading south. He will turn to attack any isolated, small groups of characters who are foolish enough to pursue him by flying or other magical means. 

The two brigands who baited the trap will disappear into the copse. If they are tracked, their trail will lead to the edge of the Great Southern Swamp near the hut of Stephen DeManis. 

# The Ancient Temple
The ancient temple of the lizardfolk is built into the side of a huge mound of muddy earth, which rise abruptly out of the swamp. The temple can be approached only by water; the earthen mound that forms its backdrop is much too treacherous to be climbed. 

The area of swamp around the temple island is so dense that the mound cannot be spotted from distances of more than one-hundred feet. The water around the mound will seem unusually dark and brackish. 

## 1. The Outer Sanctum
*After more than enough travel through these horrid swamps, you finally see a huge stone platform ahead of you, rising out of the water in the side of a sheer, muddy mound. On the surface of this platform a few marble columns still reach toward the open sky; others have fallen over and broken.*

*Three well-worn stone steps ascend from the water itself to the surface of this marble platform. A number of small skiffs are tied to spikes driven into these steps.*

*A the extreme rear of this platform you can see some type of decorated wall.*

If Stephen DeManis is with the party, he will become very excited at this point, and begin to shout, "There it is! There it is! There's where my good friend Sakatha lives! Maybe he could tame the snakes in my hair."

If the party decides to wait and watch the area for a while, they will see nothing for as long as they wait and watch. (Sakatha has been **scrying** them periodically to keep track of their progress.) As long as the party makes no move against the temple, nothing will happen. Stephen DeManis will grow greatly agitated, however, making more and more noise, and constantly urging the party forward to meet his good friend. 

If the party approaches the temple, there is a 1 in 6 chance per party member that they will notice a body just below the water in the center of the stone stairs. Investigation will reveal a fighter, still in armor but with no weapons, wearing the livery of the Baron of Or. The man has been shot in the back with a crossbow bolt. 

The party will find nothing else of note in the Outer Sanctum area. They will see that the back "wall" is not really a wall at all, but a carefully made screen of seashells tied to strings and hung closely together to give the appearance of a shell wall. 

Behind this "wall" are 10 brigand guards armed with light crossbows. They will not normally be seen until they part the curtain walls and open fire. (DC 16 Perception). 

## 2. The Inner Sanctum
*Behind the curtain wall, you see another chamber, still open to the sky. At the rear and in the center of this chamber is a large statue of a powerful, demonic being you have not seen before, crouched and open-mouthed (as if unleashing a terrible, threatening scream). The statue is not free-standing, but rather as a bas-relief carved into the rear stone wall of the chamber.*

*The walls on each side are decorated with shell mosaics. One shows a great battle between lizardfolk and humans, with the men taking the worst of it. The other shows a hideous, huge lizard-man with a gem-encrusted scepter kneeling before the same demonic figure depicted in the bas-relief. In front of the bs-relief is a large, smooth stone, about three feet high and eight feet long. It is deeply stained.*

*Three pools are in the floor of the room. Each is about 10 feet across. The pools appear to be covered with a scummy green algae.*

[[Demonic Bas-Relief.jpg]]

There is a secret door that contains the bas-relief. It is quite large at 20 feet wide. It may be opened by a **knock** spell or by placing any small gem in the open mouth of the demon depicted. The gem will roll through and be found on the other side of the door when it opens. The door opens inwards from the right. 

Each pool is the home of a **water weird**. The weirds emerge after Aulicus appears. If Aulicus does not appear, they will emerge after the party has been in the chamber for about a minute. 

If the characters have already killed the black dragon, Aulicus, he will not appear as part of this encounter. If Aulicus was not killed, he will appear from **Area 3** after the party has been in the Inner Sanctum . 

Aulicus will throw open the secret door in the panel with the demonic bas-relief and shout, "Who is disturbing my guards and my rest?!" He will then attack the party. His preferred method of attack will be to fly above the party, using his breath weapon and spells as opportunity arises. He will attempt to prevent the party from running out of the Inner Sanctum, for he knows the water weirds will be forming, and the party will probably be so distracted by his appearance that they will not notice the water weirds. He will fight to the death, and will neither negotiate nor give any information. In the unlikely event that he is subdued, he will show the party his treasure, but lie about everything else in the dungeon.

The secret trap door behind the altar stone can be opened easily once it is found. It reveals a flight of stairs 10 feet wide, which descends a distance of 30 feet to **Dungeon Level 1**. 

### Treasure
Beneath the scummy water of the weird pools, the party may find the following:

**Pool #1:** 7  pieces of jewelry: gold brooch (800 gp), gold necklace (1200 gp), coral pin (1500 gp), platinum bracelet (2800 gp), jade pin (3000 gp), gold garnet pin (4500 gp), platinum tiara with three rubies (10,000 gp)

**Pool #2:** 1600 platinum

**Pool #3:** 1300 platinum and a **potion of Polymorph**

## 3. The Lair of Aulicus
 *The door swings open to reveal a large cavern in the side of the mound. A side passageway leads off to the left.*

This is, of course, the lair of Aulicus, the black dragon. 

**Treasure:** The treasure of Aulicus is piled in a huge mound in the side passageway. It includes: 13,000 copper, 25,000 silver, 10 10gp gems, 20 50gp gems, 30 100gp gems, 35 500gp gems, 10 1,000gp gems, **Potion of Fire Resistance**, **+1 Flail**, **+1 Plate Mail**, **+1 Defender Longsword**, **Scroll of Protection from Undead**

# Dungeon Level 1: The Brigand's Lair
The noise from the battle with Aulicus (not), as well as the **scrying** of Sakatha, will have alerted the brigands on this level to the party's approach. For the rest of the adventure, Sakatha will do no more **scrying**; he is assuming that his dragon dispatched the party. He did not wait around to see the battle, for he was badly in nee do rest. Before going to sleep for eight hours, he gave orders that normal movement is now allowed. 

## Random Encounters

### 1. Lizardfolk
5 Lizardfolk from the dungeon level below. They are simply on their way outside for some random pleasures. They will attack on sight, and attempt to raise an alarm. 

200 xp/player

### 2. Brigands
10 Brigands who have been on an errand in the dungeon complex. They will attempt to flee an obviously powerful party and raise an alarm. 

125 xp/player

### 3. Clerics - The Black Iron Pact
[[The Black Iron Pact]] were in the dungeon discussing future plans with Mordrin. When they begin to fall they will escape with their **Iron Rings**. Command phrase: "Blood of Rioja"

1720 xp/player

### 4. Trolls
Two trolls that have been doing a little business with the new power in the neighborhood. They will attack the party on sight.

1080 xp/player

### 5. Wolves
8 Dire Wolves. These wolves are simply a few of the many that are allowed to wander freely through the dungeon at the behest of Sakatha. They are accustomed to being fed by the visitor to the area and by their master. They will not attack unless mistreated or attacked first. 

800 xp/player

### 6. Bats
The bats, like the wolves, are kept around by Sakatha for reasons obvious to the DM: clever players will probably make the connection between the presence of bats and possible presence of vampires. These bats will not attack unless trapped. 

### 7. Wights
4 Wight Soldiers

The wights will be headed toward the tomb level below. They are constrained by Sakatha from attacking most visitors, but will recognize the party for what they are and attack. If the encounter seems to be going against the wights, or if they are turned, they will go to the island on the tomb level and prepare to defend it. 

1120 xp/player

### 8. Demon - Abhorrent Overlord
This foul creature is already in a nasty mood, as he was ordered by a cleric to carry a few spells up to this plane. The party will provide an excellent opportunity for him to work out his frustrations. The demon's name is [[Grzzlat]]. 
 
 1000 xp/player

### 9. Jackalweres
6 Jackalweres. These beasts have come to pay their respects to Sakatha. They will be in human form when encountered, dressed as normal fighting men. They will not attack the party at first sight, but will follow from a safe distance, seeking and opportune moment to assume their true form and strike. 

240 xp/player

### 10. Bugbears
Bugbear Commander, Predator (x2), and Regular (x3). These bugbears, like the jackalweres, are paying respects on behalf of the nearest band. They have no loyalty to Sakatha, however, and if communication can be established before they attack, they can be bought off for 1d10x100 gp (or the equivalent value in gems). Each bugbear has 3-24 copper and 3-18 silver on their person. 

1328 xp/player

## 1. Guard Room
*The doors at the base of the long stairs opens easily. Beyond it you see a small room containing a wooden table, two chairs and a bottle of wine.*

This guard room is usually manned by two brigands. At the moment, however, it is empty since the guards have gone to **Room 2** to be part of the force preparing to surprise the party. 

## 2. Great Hall of the Brigands
*As you open the unlocked door to this chamber, you find yourself peering into total darkness. Suddenly, the darkness is pierced by a brilliant light, and you hear the twang of many bowstrings!*

The brigands, who heard the encounter above have prepared a reception party for the PCs. The great hall is an enormous ambush. 

The brilliant light is a **light** spell cast by [[Gormundel]], who is assisting the brigands. As soon as the party opens any door to the great hall, Gormundel will throw his **light** spell directly in the doorway, attempting to center it on the eyes of the first party member who peers in. The brigand bowmen will open fire, and then the polearm men will be sent in to charge. 

Once the melee begins, Gormundel will assist as he can with his spells, and will use his **wand of fear** if it appears that the encounter is going against the brigands. If the players are clearly winning despite his best efforts, Gormundel will be among the first to flee. He will try to return to his quarters, where he might hide or, as more likely, defend himself more effectively. If this retreat is impossible, he will flee to the surface. Fleeing brigands, however, will be completely demoralized, and will immediately attempt to escape outside. 

**Rewards:** 1750 xp/player

## 3. Storage Room
This room is merely a small storage room. It contains some worthless miscellaneous items such as cheap candle sticks, four dozen candles, and a big ball of string. 

## 4. Kitchen
This area is the brigands' kitchen. There are several tables, pots, pans, a fireplace (the vent of which is too small to climb), and miscellaneous kitchen and food service utensils. A small unlocked door leads to **Room 4A**, and a similar door to the stairs to **Room 4B**. 

## 4A. Pantry
This pantry contains enough food to supply the party for the duration of the adventure. There are good stocks of smoked fish, hams, and a variety of greens.

## 4B. Wine Cellar
This large wince cellar contains 12 barrels of good wine and one barrel of potable water.

## 5. Armory
Several empty weapon racks line the walls of this room. The only weapons here are six light crossbows, six sets of twelve crossbow bolts, and six maces.

## 6. Barracks
*You see a large number of cots with cheap mattresses scattered about the room. Beneath each of the cots is a small wooden chest.*

There are 25 cots in the room, the barracks for half of the brigand regular force. Each small chest contains some old clothes, some odds and ends of leather armor, and 2-8 gold. The fifth and 17th chests examined will also contain two 50 gold gems. All chests are locked (DC 13).

## 7. Barracks
*As you peer into this room, you quickly notice that there are a few brigands sleeping on some of the many cots that are scattered about.*

Asleep in this barracks are 10 brigands. Each keeps his sword and shield near his cot. The brigands are not in their armor. Otherwise, this room is identical to **Room 6**. 

XP: 1350

## 8. Gormundel's Chamber Door
*As you proceed down the corridor, you see that there is an 8' high bas-relief carving of a demon on the side of the corridor wall.*

This bas-relief is the sign of a secret door. This door opens in exactly the same manner as the door to Aulicus' lair in the temple complex above. 

## 8A. Gormundel's Chamber
*You see a finely furnished chamber with thick fur carpeting, a brass bed, a good wooden desk and chair, a washstand, writing equipment, and various knickknacks. There is a door in the wall to your left.*

These are Gormundel's quarters. A search of the desk will reveal that one drawer is locked. It can be opened with a **knock** spell, or by saying the **word of command**, "Open." The desk could, of course, be smashed to get at the contents of the drawer. In this drawer are several sheets of parchment with writing on them. Most contain notes on spell research that indicate old Gormundel has been research some type of spell for affecting undead, but without success thus far. One sheet of parchment contains the following verse: 

*Past the doors you cannot find, 
Down the steps you cannot climb, 
And across the River of Nothingness 
Youâ€™ll find your way. 
Beware the marksman and his prey. 
Shun the royal brides! 
Then find the place I lie in eternal feast! 
Past glories I despise; 
The light of vengeance fills my eye. 
Treasure I give my servant dragon, 
Guardian loyal of this, my reborn feeding lair.*

The brass bed is worth 2,000 gold. On the desk are two gold candelsticks worth 100 gold each. No other treasure is in the room except the furniture itself. The desk would fetch 150 gold on the open market. The carpet is worth 300 gold. 

## 9. Gormundel's Study
*The room you see has long, low work benches along the right and left walls. These benches contain such items as bottles and vials, a lamp and a burner, weights, and other alchemical equipment. Across from you, there is a reading stand in the right-hand corner of the room.*

This is Gormundel's study and laboratory. There is little of value here, except for one vial of powdered diamonds worth 350 gold. The vial can be found in one turn of searching. There is a secret door behind the reading stand. If the door is found, it cannot be opened except with a **knock** spell or by throwing a bit of the powdered diamonds directly at it. The reading stand is empty. 

## 10. Gormundel's Treasure Room
*As the door opens, you see that you are peering into total blackness.*

The blackness is caused by the **continual darkness** spell Gormundel has placed here. Careful inspection of the room will show that it is apparently completely empty. There is, however, an invisible chest against the back wall of the room, which may be found by careful searching. The chest is locked. Inside is a bag containing 500 gold, a second bag containing 500 platinum, a mass of loose silver totaling 3,500, and a book. 

The book is Gormundel's spellbook. It is finely bound in leather, and has a clasp lock. The magic runes on the front of it and on its opening page are **explosive runes**. DC 15 Dexterity saving throw vs. 5d8 lightning damage. 

## 11. Guards' Quarters
*Immediately upon opening the door, you see seven men in armor seated at a large table in the middle of the room. They have been drinking, as is shown by several wine bottles and mugs on the table, and you have apparently interrupted a dice game.*

A party that listens at the door before going into this room will hear occasional guffaws and shouts of "Come on, baby!" and "Har! You lose!"

The men are the captain of the brigand band and his six bodyguards. The captain had entrusted the handling of a minor party of intruders to his lieutenant, not wanting to interrupt his own gambling and drinking. The seven men will, of course, attack the party on sight. 

The other items in the room include six locked chests, each containing miscellaneous gear and 300 gold. 

The secret door from here to **Room 15** can be opened by a small latch hidden behind an ornamental wall hanging. 

XP: 937

## 12. Leader's Quarters
These are the quarters of two of the leaders of the group in **Room 2**. These quarters are nice but unremarkable. There are two large locked chests here, each containing 500 gold. 

## 13. Leader's Quarters 
This room is identical to **Room 12**. 

## 14. Lieutenant's Quarters
This sparsely furnished room belongs to the lieutenant of the brigand band. Aside from the usual furnishings, there is nothing to be seen. 

A careful search of the room, however, will reveal a secret hiding place at point **A** behind a loose stone in the wall. Inside this cavity is a large chest. The chest is locked, and trapped cleverly with poisoned needles that fly out in all four directions, two from each side of the chest. Inside are 6,000 silver, 4,000 gold, 200 platinum, and 6 pieces of gold jewelry (500 gold ea). 

*Dart Trap*: +5, 2d10 poison damage. 

## 15. Captain's Quarters
*This room is ornately furnished, but with the types of items that actually have little value. The overall appearance is rather tacky. The room is carpeted and contains a desk, bed, several chairs, and several wall paintings (mainly of battle scenes between men). There is a sword in a scabbard hanging over the bed.*

The sword is a **cursed berserking bastard sword**. The secret trap door in this room can be found by careful searching beneath the carpeting. It opens onto a rope ladder that descends 20 feet to a narrow (5' wide) corridor. At the end of the corridor is a ladder up to the trap door in **Room 16**. 

## 16. The Brigands' Treasure Room
*As the first member of your party peers up to the floor of the room above, they see a few glints of metal coming from a huge pile in the middle of the room. Another dark mound appears to begin moving slowly towards them.*

The trap door to this room is locked. Once the party overcomes the lock, they will find the room above completely dark, and the air filled with a horrid staleness and a mild stench. A light shining into the room will reveal what the DM should describe as two large mounds: one of treasure, and one that looks like a heap of rotting vegetation. The second mound is a shambling mound. This creature has been sent to guard the brigands' treasure. It will not leave the treasure room, but will attack anyone who enters. 

**Treasure:** 3,000 copper, 4,000 gold, 4,000 platinum, 5 gold necklaces (300 gold ea), 5 gemmed silver rings (1,000 gold ea), 5 jade bracelets (1,500 gold ea), a **potion of speed**, and a **scroll of web**. 

## 17. Empty Room
*This room appears to be completely empty, except for a few chairs scattered about*. 

## 18. Worship Area
*As you round a turn in the corridor, you see ahead what is clearly some type of worship area. In the center of this area is a large, free-standing marble statue of the same demonic type you have already seen. Behind the statue is a darkly stained altar stone. On each side of the statue there are small, 5' diameter pools. Behind the altar is a tapestry depicting a human captive. There are doors leading out of this area to the right and to the left.*

This area is reserved for worship by the brigands and by the demon-worshiping clerics who are in league with them and with Sakatha. The pools are filled with unholy water. Close examination of the altar will reveal that the bloodstains are fresh. The entire area radiates evil. 

## 19. Empty Room

## 20. Clerical Preparation Room
*In the center of this room is a large round table. A stick of incense in a burner is on the center of the table. Around the room are a set of pegs driven into the walls. Silver-trimmed black robes hang from seven of these pegs. A large basin of water is beside the door to the previous room.*

*This is the room used by the demonic clerics for meditation, preparation for ceremonies, etc. The robes are normal roves; the room, however, will radiate evil.*

## 21. Clerical Study
*You see what appears to be a small library. There are about 100 books scattered about on shelves around the walls, and two or three books lying on a large table in the center of the room. There is a reading stand against the back wall of the room, upon which a large tome lies open.*

Examination of the books in this room will reveal that they are standard sorts of works that would be of general interest to clerics of chaotic evil alignment. The book on the reading stand, however, is a **Book of Vile Darkness**. It is chained to the reading stand. 

## 22. Cleric's Cell
*A man in a silver-trimmed black robe is seated at a desk in this small room. He is reading quietly, and looks up at you as soon as the door opens.*

This man is a cleric especially chosen by Mordrin for the great work beginning in this area. The man is totally loyal to his faith--in fact, fanatical. He will die rather than reveal useful information to the party. If possible, he will raise an alarm, which will bring the clerics from **24** and **25** to his aid. This particular cleric's name is Almar.

## 23-26. Clerics' Cells
These cells are identical to **Room 22** except for their clerics. 

## 27. Secret Door to Room 28
This wall is covered by a painting of the demon worshiped by the clerics. The door can be opened with a **knock** spell or when it is sprinkled with unholy water.

## 28. Chamber of the Patriarch
### A. Vestibule
This finely carpeted little room contains a long wooden bench and a basin of unholy water. 

### B. Main Chamber
*As you peer into this chamber, you see a man in plate mail armor kneeling in prayer in front of a small shrine. The opening of the door has alerted him to your presence, and he rises quickly, turns, and faces you.*

The man is Patriarch Ui-Lon. He is wearing **+1 plate mail** and wields a **staff of the serpent**. 

Ui-Lon will quickly move against any intruders with a fierce and fanatical wrath. He is especially fond of causing death by poisoning, and can seldom pass up the opportunity to do so. 

His chamber is richly furnished with fine carpeting and several fine items, such as a pair of silver candelabra worth 600 gold. The walls are hung with black curtains all around, except in front of the small shrine built into the back wall. This shrine houses the candelabra and a small, black statue of the cleric's demon-god. The statue is wroth 2,500 gold because of its workmanship, but any person touching and carrying it is 1% likely cumulative per day to attract the attention of a Demon. The secret door behind the curtain in the slanting wall is opened by lifting up the statue, or by a **knock** spell. 

## 29. Temple Treasury
*In contrast to the luxury of the room you are standing in, this is a small, musty room of bare stone, covered with cobwebs except in its very center. Three chests - one large and two very small - are in the center of the room.*

All three chests are locked and covered with contact poison. (DC 18 Perception to detect). 

The large chest contains 5,000 gold and 2,000 platinum. The small chests each contain a small cylindrical ivory case with an ivory 'stopper' in one end. Each of these cases is worth 500 gold. Inside the first case is a cursed scroll that will give whoever reads it two levels of Exhaustion. The second case contains a **scroll of protection from demons**. 

## 30. Trap Room
*This appears to be just another empty room. There are doors on the two walls to your right and left.*

The room is empty, but the door at **A** is actually a mimic. 

The other door is a false door. It can be hacked away in one turn. 

Once it is located, the secret door at **B** can easily be swung open.

## 31. Trap Room

This room is identical in all respects to **Room 30**. If, however, the party was attacked by the mimic in **30**, there will be no mimic in **31** and vice versa; the party should face only one mimic in this area of the dungeon. 

## 32. Exit to Tomb Level
*You see nothing in this area but a corridor 30' long.*

Actually, there is a secret trap door in the floor of this room. Once found, the trap door can easily be opened, and will reveal a set of stone stairs leading to the tomb level. The stairs descend at a modest angle, and at their bottom the party will barely be able to see some type of stone floor. 

The stairs are trapped, and when the first character steps on the fifth stair, will recede with an enormous noise and become a very steep inclined plane. Any character on the stairs will need to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Those who make the save will be clinging to the smooth rock of the inclined plane, and will have to find some way to get back up. Those who fail will plummet 30' to the flaming pit that has appeared at the foot of the ramp.
