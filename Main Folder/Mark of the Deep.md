*Curse, rare*

A creature cursed with this mark begins its slow transformation into a Deep One, a strange fish-like humanoid aberration that live in the sea and serve the Old Voice. A creature with this curse should not instantly know the following details, however they may learn information with appropriate History or Religion checks, certain spells, or finding NPCs with knowledge o the curse. 

The beginning of the transformation could be ween as beneficial: the creature immediately gains darkvision 60 feet if they didn't already have it, along with a swim speed equal to their movement speed. A few months later, they begin having strange dreams of underwater cities both magnificent and terrible, with strange architectures that seem to defy regular geometry. They feel a compulsion toward entering the water, and slowly in their dreams they contact the Old Voice, who invites the creature to join it in the sea. 

As the transformation continues, the creature gains gills and the ability to breathe underwater; their hair falls out, they gain a pronounced slouch, their eyes begin to bulge out and they stop blinking. Slowly but surely, they undergo a full transformation. 

While the transformation is still undergoing, the creature can be cured with a *remove curse* spell or similar ability. Once fully transformed into a Deep One, however, the curse can only be reversed with the most powerful magic, such as the *wish* spell.
