# Background
In the sewers underneath [[Cadun (DM)]] an ambitious were-rat alchemist known only as "the Rat King" set up a base of operations years ago. In one of the abandoned, cavernous labs left behind by the [[Circle of Cuthbert]] this creature has been using alchemy and magic to mutate and breed loyal rat minions. To sustain his operations, he sends his rat minions out into the world to collect supplies: from food and drink to other necessary equipment. 

The initial motives for the Rat King's experimentation is a mystery even to himself. At some point during his time in these caverns, a dark influence took hold of him, slowly driving him insane. The Rat King now has once clear goal in his crazed mind: to create an army of mutant rats and take over the surface, to escape and protect the world from what he calls " the Old Voice," a malicious entity that whispers to him endlessly from the deep. 

Unknown to all the current cavern inhabitants is that in ancient times long forgotten, this was a meeting place for a nefarious cult that worshiped [[Cult of the Old Voice|the Old Voice]]. The cultists left the surface world long ago, but dark remnants remain: a shrine here, an altar there. The poor fools that spend too much time near these sinister devices are susceptible to the Old Voice's whispers, inviting them to join it in the deep waters below. 

## Hooks
**Rescue Mission:** 
	[[Bryce Halfheart]], a restless teen with an adventurer's spirit, has gone missing. His father, a blacksmith named [[Ilfen Halfheart]], fears that the boy got lost in the sewers after hearing rumors that some sort of treasure might be down there. Ilfen offers 150 gp reward per person and free lodging in the rooms above his shop for his son's safe return. 
**The Armor of Invulnerability:**
	If the PCs succeed on a DC 15 Streetwise check in one of Cadun's bars they overhear some drunken mercenaries talking about the legendary *armor of invulnerability*, once the prized possession of legendary wizard named [[Oswald the Tailor]]. Supposedly it was lost deep within a cavern connected to the sewers under the city. The mercenaries argue over the details of this rumor -- who owned the armor, how strong it really was, how it was lost -- but they all agree that it's somewhere in the cavern. Many have journeyed down into the depths to retrieve the armor, but none have returned. The mercenaries boast that they'll claim the armor for themselves, but right now their too busy drinking, working, and recovering from injuries. 

## Common Features
The caverns are dank, musty, and dirty. Typical sounds include the dripping of water from stalactites, the echoing chitter of rats, and the soft murmur of a stream. As the PCs explore the caverns, they'll discover several recurring features throughout:
	**Lighting:** 
		All areas within the cavern are unlit unless noted otherwise. 
	**Ceilings and Walls:** 
		The natural caverns vary between 10 to 30 feet high. The jagged and uneven walls have many hand and footholds, but they are slick with moisture; climbing the walls in these locations requires a DC 15 Athletics check, and a failure by 5 or more results in a fall. 
	**Tunnels:** 
		The natural tunnels vary between 10 to 15 feet high. 
	**Stalagmites and Stalactites:** 
		of various sizes jut out from the rough natural tunnels, potentially offering cover and hiding spots but not impeding general travel. 

## Random Patrols
The Rat King's lair is infested with his mutant rat minions, and it's possible that a random pack of them will run into the PCs as they explore the caverns. These rat encounters can happen in **areas A, B, D, J, and K**. 

If the PCs are making liberal use of short and long rests between clearing out sections of the dungeon, the Rat King may be alerted of intruders by scouting rats and starts sending out patrols. 

Additionally, if the PCs are looking to control a specific type of mutant rat with a *potion of rat control* but cannot find one in the dungeon it may be a good idea to throw a random patrol at them containing the rat they seek. 

# Chambers and Encounters
## Area A: Cave Entrance
This tunnel is the main entrance into the Rat King's domain. His rat minions bring in the food they forage from outside through here. A DC 10 Perception or Investigation check spots a small trail of food crumbs -- bread, cheese, salted pork -- leading deeper into the cavern in **area B**. 

### Combat
A mix of **giant rats** and **spider rats** guard the entrance. They watch the tunnel from their hiding spots: the giant rats peeking out of holes in the bumpy tunnel walls and the spider rats clinging to stalactites hanging from the ceiling. A DC 14 Perception check spots the giant rats; a DC 18 Perception check spots the spider rats. 

If the spider rats aren't spotted before they attack, read when they strike:
	*A high-pitched hiss alerts you to trouble from above. On the ceiling is an eight-legged, multi-eyed rodent. It bares its needle-like teeth before leaping off the ceiling at you.* 
	5 **Giant Rat**, 5 **Rat Spider** 
		200 xp

## Area B: Storage Room
This open cave room has been carved out from the amin tunnel. All food that has been foraged or stolen by the rats from the outside world is gathered here where they are carefully organized and stored for later distribution. There is a secret door in the northern wall of the chamber. 

*Large musty wooden barrels line the walls of this chamber. Piled atop the barrels or propped beside them are smaller casks of wine and ale. A small leather book sits on one of the barrels, alongside a small glass vial containing a strange liquid.* 

PCs investigating the room can easily find wine, ale, salted pork and beef, dried fruit, nuts, and stale bread. 

### Swinging Axe Trap
A 5-foot square of the cave floor near the entrance has been transformed into a clever pressure plate trap. The cavern inhabitants know to avoid stepping on it. 
**Detecting the Trap:**
	A successful DC 12 Perception check reveals the edges of worked stone along the pressure plate's boundaries. 
**Triggering the Trap:**
	The pressure plate triggers if at least 20 pounds of pressure is placed on it. Once triggered, an axe suspended along the ceiling by ropes is released. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. 

### The Rat King's Journal (#1)
A small leather-bound journal sits on one of the barrels in plain view. This is one of the Rat King's many journals, which he pours his addled thoughts into before he misplaces and forgets it. The chicken-scratch entries are mostly insane ramblings. A DC 12 Investigation check reveals excerpts of important information. 

### Secret Door
A successful DC 15 Investigation check notices a crease in the northern wall. The wall is hinged and can be opened outward by gipping crevices in the wall as makeshift handles, revealing a secret chamber (**area C**). 
## Area C: Secret Chamber
*This small square room is layered thick with dust and cobwebs. Random bits of old clothing are strewn about the floor haphazardly. Staring at you with bulbous eyes is a strange fish-like humanoid statue garbed in priestly robes. At its webbed stone feet lays a pile of coins.*

This cavern was used long ago by cultists of the Old Voice. Back then, the cultists would leave their final earthly possessions in this small room before proceeding down into the waters below. 

The ancient clothing on the floor here is mundane, moldy, and covered in dust. 

The surface of of the statue secretes a thin layer of of dark mucous. The pile of treasure at its feet contains 400 cp, 160 sp, 8 gp, and a citrine gemstone (10 gp). 

Within the pockets of one of the discarded robes is a medallion (15 gp) that oddly shimmers in the dark. Anyone staring at the medallion intently begins to have a nagging sensation of unease.
