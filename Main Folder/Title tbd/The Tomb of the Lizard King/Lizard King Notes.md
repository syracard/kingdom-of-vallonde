*Adaptation of the Tomb of the Lizard King* by Mark Acres

# Introduction
For many years there has been peace in the lands of [[the Baron of Or]], John Brunis. The fertile plain of the River Ardo has yielded bountifully, commerce has prospered, and the rule of the successive barons has been generally wise and just. But of late, disturbing reports of highway robbery have reached the palace at [[Vendare]], the major city of Or. According to the tales of whimpering merchants, the southlands are being overrun by a band of vicious brigands. Already there has been a complete halt to the rich trade caravans to and from Or's southern neighbors.

Three weeks ago Baron Brunis sent a squad of 30 warriors to the affected area near the small village of [[Waycombe]]. So far there has been no report, no message, no rider â€” not even a rumor of their fate. Suddenly gravely concerned, the baron has called for a special group of volunteers to go to the Waycombe area, discover the fate of the first expedition, investigate the reports of highway robbery, and if possible put an end to this trouble. Those who answer his call can expect danger, but also great reward, for the baron is known as a generous man who rewards his loyal subjects well. 

# The Palace of the Count of Or
## 1. A Private Meeting
*Hearing of the count's need, your party has responded. Brigands usually manage to accumulate a good deal of treasure, and they usually aren't particularly tough to handle. These brigands, however, may be tougher than usual, for as you sit waiting outside the baron's audience chamber, you see a succession of seasoned adventurers and mercenaries enter full of enthusiasm, only to leave shortly with looks of disappointment and fear.*

*As you sit pondering this strange situation, the door to the audience chamber swings open and the chamberlain announces that it is now your party's turn to meet the baron of Or.*

*As you enter, you see John Brunis, fifth baron of Or, seated comfortably on a high seat at the end of a long table. Standing behind him, resplendent in his robes of bright yellow and blue, is [[Jorlon]], the High Priest of Vendare, a man who commands a large following among the people of Or. In his right hand Jorlon holds a slim, tapered wand of ivory. The tip of this wand is made of beryl.* 
	Beryl is a sky-blue mineral. 

*The room itself is richly but tastefully appointed with curtains, tapestries, and other objects of value.*

*"Welcome, courageous volunteers!" the count says to you. "I assume you understand the nature of the task at hand?"*

Brunis will question the party members about their experiences, previous adventures, and skill in dealing with danger. He will then simply chat for a while, apparently trying to get some idea o the nature of the party. Jorlon will stand quietly, seeming to be almost asleep on his feet and taking no notice of the conversation. In fact, the wand in his hand is a **wand of enemy detection** that he has already used to determine the party is not immediately hostile. He is now quietly performing an **augury**, using several small beads hidden in his left hand. The hand is covered by the sleeves and folds of his robe. 

After three of four minutes, Jorlon will look directly at John Brunis and nod his head once slowly. Brunis will now become very businesslike. He says:

*"You are accepted for this task. What you must do seems simple. Travel to the village of Waycombe in the south. Learn the fate of my soldiers; they were led by [[Barto Trume]], one of my most trusted lieutenants. Then find these detestable brigands and eliminate them; summary justice is approved by my authority. Above all else, find out if there is any further evil behind these vicious attacks. If so, eliminate it. Your reward for success will be whatever you regain from the evil you discover, plus my personal gratitude.*

To the best of his ability, the count will answer any questions the party may have at this time. He will agree to cover the costs of outfitting the party with any unusual or costly items they desire, as long as their demands do not exceed 2500gp worth of merchandise. If the party members ask whether the count has reason to believe there is more Waycombe than mere brigands, he will simply glance at Jorlon, smile, and say, "So I have been told." Jorlon will say nothing, even if directly questioned.

The baron will then suggest that the party come into the main council room where merchants have assembled to give their firsthand reports to the party selected to deal with the brigands. 

## 2. The Merchants' Complaints
*The baron leads you into the large chamber used for public audiences. He sits behind the center of a long table, facing the crowd in the room, and gestures for you to take seats on either side of him. Jorlon, silent as ever, stands behind the baron.*

*The audience chamber is filled with merchants. Their chattering has been hushed by the count's entrance. Scattered about the room are a few men clad in armor, obviously mercenary guards. The two large doors at the rear of the chamber are manned by guards in the baron's livery. In each corner behind you, you notice a cleric in yellow and blue robes. Both are standing quietly with their heads lowered, occasionally muttering a soft word of devotion to themselves or to their deity.*

In addition to the party, Baron Brunis, and Jorlon, the following people are in the room:
	23 Merchants who are unarmored and unarmed.
	6 Mercenary Guards who have been disarmed before being allowed in the audience hall.
	2 Clerics who are without armor or weapons.

The baron will introduce the party to this assembly, then ask the merchants to give what information they can to the party. The result will be a babble of wailing, moaning, and groaning over goods and treasure lost, guards killed, captured or fled, and so forth. In fact, the din will become so unmanageable that the baron will order silence, and suggest that the party question the merchants, rather than letting them all speak freely. 

All of the merchants in the room are involved in the caravan trade with Or's southern neighbors. Some are honest, a few are not, but none are in league with the brigands. All have suffered losses from the brigand raids. in answer to specific questions from party members, the merchants will provide the following information:
1. The attacks by the brigands almost always occur along the main highway near Waycombe and [[the Great Southern Swamp]].
2. The brigands always seem to come from the south.
3. The brigands look like humans.
4. The merchants believe the brigands to be very tough fighters. Their mercenary guards have been ineffective against the brigands; most of the guards seem to flee the instant the attacks begin. 
5. The brigands actively pursue the fleeing guards. The merchants believe that many have been taken prisoner.
6. The brigand attacks are always preceded by the appearance of a harmless-looking little old man who stops the head of the merchants' columns to ask for directions.

If the party questions any of the fighters present, they will be able to add that only a few brigands appear to be really tough fighters; most of the brigands choose to pursue the panic-stricken guards who flee when the attacks begin. So far, none of the guards have been able to take a brigand prisoner; indeed, they are usually lucky to escape with their lives. There is usually great confusion during the brigand attacks, so the number of brigands is hard to estimate.

Note that the only way that the party may obtain this information is by careful questioning. 

While the party is questioning the merchants and their guards, secretly roll saves vs. [[Sakatha]]'s **scrying** spell. Sakatha is using a crystal ball to keep track of happenings in the baron's palace. Any character who succeeds on their save should be informed that they "have a strong feeling that someone is watching the party."

The Dungeon Master should also occasionally remind the party of the presence of the clerics in the corners behind them. The Dungeon Master should do this by saying, every few minutes, "And of course you hear the clerics in the background saying 'May the powers of good protect this place and all herein' and other things of this sort."

Any character who keeps a careful watch on these clerics will notice that after a few minutes one of them leaves and is replaced by another from outside the room. This is a scheduled routine relief; Brunis and Jorlon will take no notice of it. The replacement cleric is dressed identically to the first one and will behave in exactly the same way. However, he is in fact the chaotic evil [[Mordrin|High Priest Mordrin]], an ally of Sakatha. 

Mordrin is wearing chainmail beneath his robes, and is armed with a mace. He is carrying two packets of **dust of disappearance**. 

After rolling for the detection of *Scrying* and giving any successful character a chance to take action, the DM should resume playing the role of the merchants, and continue to mimic occasionally the chanting of the clerics. The third time he repeats the chanting, the DM should say, "Oh great power of evil, destroy now thine enemies..." The DM should then count to five out loud. Any characters still within ten feet of the count's table when the DM reaches "five" will be caught in the *Flame Strike* that has just been cast by Mordrin. 

Any character who reacts in time to avoid the *Flame Strike* will also have been able to spot the cleric who cast it. The other characters will not realize for one melee round exactly what has happened. 

Mordrin had hoped to kill Baron Brunis with this *Flame Strike*. After casting it, he will attempt to escape, using his robes as a disguise. The merchants, mercenary guards, and baron's guards present will all be too stunned to react swiftly; if Mordrin is to be stopped, he must be stopped by the party. Mordrin's preferred plan is to cast *Sanctuary* on himself, then duck out of the room and use his **dust of disappearance**.

The DM may modify this plan as the situation requires; however, it is very important that every effort be made to allow Mordrin to escape. The DM should assume that once Mordrin makes it outside the palace gates, he has effectively escaped. 

In the unlikely event that Mordrin is captured, he will resist all attempts at interrogation, will attempt to escape by any means possible, and will prefer death to giving information to the count or the party.  It is vitally important that the party not learn the secret of Sakatha's reappearance at this time. 

Meanwhile, the DM should note that, even if the party attempts to warn them before the flames hit, both John Brunis and Jorlon will be caught in the *Flame Strike*. 

## 3. Aftermath
Following the attack by Mordrin, the baron will urge the party to make all possible speed on their mission, for he no "fears the worst" and feels that "quick, decisive action is vitally important." More than this he will not willingly say. If compelled to speak by some magic means, he will share his fears about vague legends he has heard concerning the Great Lizard King Sakatha, who once dwelled in the Great Southern Swamp. According to legends, this horrid being is to return someday to take vengeance on the house of the Barons of Or. 

If one or more party members were killed by Mordrin's *Flame Strike*, Jorlon will agree to cast *Raise Dead*, provided the party agrees to swear an oath to perform their mission for the baron. 

The party may purchase any type of normal equipment in Vendare. Information, however, will be harder to find. The only knowledge available in the city is the fact that peasants in the south are reputed to know many legends about lizardfolk who lived in the Great Southern Swamp a very long time ago. 

Some parties will insist upon outfitting a fake merchant's caravan to make the trip to the south. John Brunis will strongly advise against this plan, citing the dangers of both delay in preparation and of surprise attack. An extremely insistent party will be able to persuade the baron to bear the expenses of outfitting such an expedition. The baron will agree to pay for twenty mercenary guards. These guards will not fight, however, unless it is absolutely necessary in order to save their own lives. They will give up accompanying the party when they reach Waycombe. 

# The Journey to Waycombe

The DM may show the party the hex map of Or, and allow the party to use it when planning and making their journey to the Waycombe area. The rate of travel on the highways or through the countryside will be forty miles (eight hexes) per day for a party mounted on average horses, or half that rate for a party on foot. food and shelter are readily available at the inns marked along the way, and from peasants in the villages on the map.
