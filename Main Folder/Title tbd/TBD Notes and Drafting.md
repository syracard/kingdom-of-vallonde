**World Location:** The island of [[Conclave]] and [[The Denitric Archipelago]].  
**Overall Plot and Antagonists:** There are a couple of options here depending on the themes, mechanics, or types of stories that we want to explore. 
1. Exiled house from [[The Sister Cities|Keyhearth]]. 
2. Dispatched to investigate rumors of a divine artifact. 
3. Members of [[The Pickling Guild]] sent to investigate increased extraplanar activity.
### Potential House Rules
Daggerheart gold system
Daggerheart 'projects' system vs. In depth item crafting/creation *vis.* **Loot Table** sources (this one probably favors the Pickling Guild start if everyone is interested)?
See Tasha's optional rules

### Stuff to Work Out
Landing city and town along the road to Vendare

### Modules/Long-term Plot Beats
1. Intro: Depends on origin this will change. So.... figure out @ Session 0
	2. Introduce [[the Bloodstone]] here.
	3. Seed rumors about the issues in [[Or]] and the generosity and good rule of [[the Baron of Or]]. 
2. Tomb of the Lizard King
	1. This will help to develop the local area of where the party shows up on Conclave and introduce them to the regional politics.
