Conclave is a large island (we'll say the diameter at the longest point is roughly the length of Britain) west of [[the Denitric Archipelago]]. 

The denizens of the island belong do different factions (that style themselves as 'kingdoms'). They aren't so much kingdoms in the formal/traditional sense, but more like relatively decentralized gangs led by whoever manages to secure the loyalty of enough other leaders, settlements, etc. 

The low-centralization of Conclave is a result of a popular myth among the people there: that there is an artifact, [[the Bloodstone]], hidden somewhere on the island. Whoever can find it and master it would rule the entire Conclave. 

**Demographics:** There are more peoples of an extraplanar heritage (genasi, tieflings, etc.) who make their home on Conclave. This is due to the weaker planar barriers in the vicinity of the island. Scholars are unsure (there aren't many scholars on Conclave to begin with...) but some believe it may be connected to the Bloodstone, but they're unsure of exactly how or why this is the case.
