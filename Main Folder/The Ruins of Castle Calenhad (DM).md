**Flaws, Ideals, Personality...**

Might. The world is divided into the strong who rule and the weak who obey or die.
I fawn over others to make my betrayal more unexpected.
Oily Boils. Each time the demon takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, the area within 5 feet of it becomes difficult terrain until the end of the demon's next turn.
