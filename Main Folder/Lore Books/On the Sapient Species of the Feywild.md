# On the Archfey
The Archfey are a somewhat inscrutable group to outsiders. The closest way that we may think of them is as some mix of high-lord and demi-god. These beings forge pacts and hold grudges that last many of our generations.... I advise extreme caution if you ever find yourself in the presence of an Archfey. They may be benevolent or more mercurial. Choose your words carefully as they will be binding; a pact formed with an Archfey will be enforced by the very magic of the Feywild itself. 
# On *Eladrin*
The *Eladrin*, or 'Fey Elves' as some call them are the members of the Fairfolk who remained in the Feywild. This has resulted in the natural mutability of their forms. Of the different communities of Elves (High, Wood, Drow) the Eladrin bear the closest resemblance to the ur-Elven community: *The Eldardrim*.  
# On the Gnomes
Gnomes are sometimes thought of as the Fey mirror to the Halflings of Osstor, but they are actually quite distinct. By all accounts the origins of Gnomish communities in the Feywild contributed to their natural affinity for different magical crafting. The most famous of these communities is the well-known settlement of [[Ronsenberg]]. 

# On Goblinkin
Most people may not realize that Goblins, Hobgoblins, Bugbears and their ilk, scourges upon Osstor that they may be, actually originate from the Feywild. Their exact origins are unknown, but we have collected accounts of them being in service of Archfey and other powers before they spread across the other planes.
