9/21/23 Session
	~~Post conflict w/[[Ashyra, Keeper of the Crypt]]. Party will deal with the leaders of the [[Onssbruck Cartel]] (Gimurt, Riswynn, and Rurik). Presumably Nick's character will want to interrogate Riswynn regarding his stuff.
	*Interrogation of Riswynn*
		**Great Success:** Riswynn will divulge the name of [[Lady Ravenna]], a priestess residing in Osstun and who is may have connections to [[The Cabal of the Dread Trinity]], specifically [[The Syndicate of Bhaal]]. 
		**Moderate Success:** Riswynn will reveal that there is a priestess in Osstun, connected to the Cabal who was involved.

	*Meeting [[Lemuel|Lemuel Thorpe]]*
		Lemuel is a skeletal lawyer representing the [[Immortal Legion]]. He will come to the heroes camp in the evening, offering acquaintance between their organizations. He would reveal the name of the legion's commander, [[Lord Soth]]. And offer his business card, letting them know that if they ever think they might need the legion's assistance in any way, to simply burn it and he will arrive to draw up the contract. 
	*Aftermath of Agros*
		With the removal of the leaders of the cartel, tensions are beginning to wind down in the city. With the spring thaw work will return but there will be improvements to be made. ~~
	*The House of Grundi*
		There's a small village just south of Grundi Hall. It seems like it's been abandoned for a few years at least now. To the northwest you can see the mountains over look the dark blue lake that accents this rustic countryside of the northern Empire. 
		Approaching the manor hall it will seem pristine at first before the illusion fades and its disrepair is revealed. Inside the party will find Gunter, a wretched little thing of a Dwarf who will be drawn to Smallzo's necklace. If encouraged he may even cut out his own eye to offer it as tribute. He'll hint at his master residing at the lake and can lead the party there for a confrontation with Luunthig.

Year: 756 of the Age of Kings (denoted by the collapse of the Dwarven Empire and the ‘spinning off’ of the Kingdom of Vallonde under the first Vallo king).

Circle of Smiting: As an action, you scrape your axe in a circle on the ground around you and holy fire emits from it. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 radiant damage (half as much on a success). The fire lasts for one minute and any creature that ends its turn also must succeed on this save against the damage. While this effect is active you have resistance to fire damage. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.

**Adventures and Content**

●      316 Mining Company

**Notes for Session**

_Arcane Ether:_ This is info known by Davras. Magic items can be reduced to a magical dust, Ether through a process of disenchantment. Ether can be used to enhance spellcasting (though it comes at a cost), to replace components of spells (it is always consumed), and it is required for the creation of all advanced magic items (_very rare_ and above). The process to disenchant an item in this way takes time depending on how powerful the item is and requires a forge made of white obsidian, an expensive stone that is only found on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Enchanters who wish to make a new forge and don’t have access to this material routinely pay upwards of 100,000 gp for the raw materials alone. 

_Thimdurr Upgrade:_ Becomes a +2; **Strength of the Forebears:** While attuned to Thimdurr, if your strength score is less than 20 it becomes 20.; **Dwarven Roar:** Once per day while holding Thimdurr you may roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intimidation skill bonus). On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

_Lady Bruga’s Return:_ When Lady Bruga returns to the party with what she knows, she will share that she discovered a monument high in the mountains that is dedicated to the successful defeath of Ashardalon. It depicts heroes from the four peoples who interred the beast: humans, elves, dwarves, and giants. Inscriptions indicated that the Anchors were placed under the original settlements of these peoples in the area. Bruga knows that for humans this was the Sunken Citadel and for dwarves it was Agros. The elf part was confusing at first until she realized that it was a drow that was depicted in the statue, so their Anchor must be in one of their Underdark cities.

            **Secrets that Can Be Uncovered:**

●      While the giants once ruled a large kingdom from their moutaintops, their decline coincided with the rise of the Dwarven Empire. After the defeat of Ashardalon, the first emperor, Callus I betrayed an agreement that had been struck between the dwarves and giants, and raided their mountain halls of treasure and magic. After the fall of the giant kingdoms for the most part they moved on from this world, some of them traveled to the various elemental planes while others left to go to Yotunheim on the plane of Ysgard. There are still rumors that daring adventurers might find the ruined remains of their palaces and great halls high in the mountains.

●      Exploring beyond the monument may lead to the ruins of the giant city of Yotunhall.

**The Crashed Squid Ship**

Deep underneath a hill south of the Great Forest is a decrepit astral corvette: one of the vessels illithid use to traverse the planes. It is comprised of three decks, is a 40ft diameter cylinder, and is infested with

**The Sodium Gate**

            Andert the farmer comes to Murus after the opening festivities of the casino. He reveals that he trades with some members of the Pickling Guild who referred him to the club. They also told him that there is a higher up in the guild who is looking for adventurers to aid them in some project on the edge of the desert. Outside of the town of Fywold where Director Finasaer is attempting to stabilize a portal to the elemental plain of salt.

**Future Hooks**

■      Many stories about this powerful magical artifact

■      Source of creation/life/magic/etc.

○      Travel to Port Ronsenberg

■      Capital for pirates and skyship builders

○      The path to the city must be discovered; because of the fundamental, building blocks of creation magic surrounding the ruined city the pathways to it are hidden and ever changing

■      In the ruins there are pieces of ancient Arcadian skyships that can be reassembled. A reassembled skyship will always be able to travel back to the city

**Magic Items**

●      Ascendant property for Blood-drinker

○      Blood drinker becomes a +2 magic weapon and it deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage.

○      **Bloodrage:** As a bonus action, you let the magic of Blood-Drinker consume you and you enter a blood rage. While raging you cannot concentrate on spells and you have disadvantage on Wisdom saves. Additionally while raging you have resistance to necrotic damage, are vulnerable to radiant damage, and attacks you make with Blood-Drinker deal an additional 1d6 + 2 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt with this weapon. You can use the feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after completing a long rest.

**Past Sessions**

●      In the late evening as you set up your camp you spy something on the horizon. Based on the distance, its apparent size, and its speed it must be some large airborne creature. It’s flying along the northeast quadrant of the horizon. Later, during the third watch you see a flash of flame to the north along the mountains. It’s about five to ten miles away. You hear a roar come from the location of whatever is happening—it must be incredibly loud for how far away it is. The action last for one, maybe two minutes before the fires cease and the night returns to darkness. 

●      Reward Snorri’s faith

○      Steal puzzles from SG-1—Prudence, Charity, Kindness, Wisdom, Faith

○      _Only those of virtue true may win the prize concealed beyond the reach of the flawed and tainted. Thimdurr shall belong to the Dwarf who seeks Prudence, Wisdom, Kindness, Charity, and Faith. Be the truest of hearts and ye shall find the reward._

○      Background: The Tomb of Emperors is a site of pilgrimage for dwarves to honor the first generations of imperial conquest. It is rumored that dwarven warriors who display the virtues of Prudence, Charity, Kindness, Wisdom, and Faith will be rewarded by their ancestors. Specifically, it is fabled that Thimdurr, the legendary battleaxe of Korvold ‘the Fairykiller’ Ironbottom.

○      Upon entering the foyer visitors are presented with a choice: THE TRIAL or THE ALTAR

○      In the first chamber of the trials are two fountains. In various positions around the room are other aspirants, frozen in place. They must display prudence by taking their time and figuring out the maze.

○      In the next chamber you see an altar with various pieces of treasure placed on it. As you enter all of the doors seal shut. They must relinquish a valued item.

○      _See the way that is just and true._ They hear a rumble—parts of the dungeon are starting to collapse—and they hear the sound of a crying child. If they follow everyone must help to release them.

○      Separated and presented with puzzles.

~~■~~      P1:  _I’m struck and cut, shaped and cooled, then bound by rings to release what’s stored._

○      Approaching the final chamber you are barred by a wall of fire.

○      _Thimdurr shall instead belong to he who speaks the Master’s name._
