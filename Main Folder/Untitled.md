		Advantage on Deception and Persuasion checks. 
		You can use a bonus action to make a Deception or Persuasion check against a creature that can hear you within 60 feet contested by their Wisdom check. If you succeed, that creature cannot attack you or target you with a spell until the start of your next turn. A creature with an Intelligence score less than 4 is immune to this effect. You may use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Proficiency modifier
