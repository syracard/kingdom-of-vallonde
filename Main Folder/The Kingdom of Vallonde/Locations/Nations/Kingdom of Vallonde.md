Vallonde takes up the fertile farmlands, river, and coastal region south of the [[Tev'ash Empire]] and east of the [[Strodfjall Mountains]]. 

It's major settlements include [[The Sister Cities]] and [[Mayheath]]. The monarch has ruled from [[Dorian's Rest]], the castle that [[Dorian I]] built after winning his independence war against the empire. 

The population of Vallonde is mainly human, but there are pockets of halfling, half-orc, and dwarven communities. 

In Kings 746, there was a coup against the elder king when the red dragon, [[Piru, the Volcanic Rage]] along with her ally at court, [[Lord Scalcotz]], assassinated the king and established Scalcotz as the puppet steward of the kingdom. 

Under the rulership of Piru, a small, lesser known group of knights, [[The Order of the Black Rose]], gained power as they were connected to Scalcotz's family. Ten years of their bullishness and Piru's greed has put the kingdom on the tipping point of civil war as the last Vallo heir, [[Amil Vallo]], has remerged to reclaim his throne.
