The Sister Cities include two settlements on the islands southwest of the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]]. While they are loyal vassals of the kingdom, there have always been tensions between the two entities as the cities are the economic hub of the kingdom. 

The two cities themselves are Keyhearth and Osstun. Keyhearth is the older of the two settlements, some saying it was one of the first settlements that emerged in this part of the world. Keyhearth even served as the capital of the [[Tev'ash Empire]] for a time. Osstun, on the other hand, is somewhat younger and less prosperous than its northern sibling. While Keyhearth is administered by a lord mayor who is selected from the leadership of the mercantile families of its upper crust, Osstun is the ducal seat of the region. While Keyhearth is ostensibly subservient to the duke of Osstun, [[Ludwig von Osstun]] has been relegated to nothing more than a local crime boss for some time now. 

Major organizations with in the cities are [[The Coinsguard]], [[The Pickling Guild]], and [[The Five Families]]. 

Keyhearth Neighborhoods
	Oldeport
		This is the entrance to the city where traders and travelers come to trade their wares and visit the city. There are seemingly hundreds of intertwining docks, piers, and jetties that create a maze of boardwalks with the larger vessels weighing anchor in the deeper waters and smaller vessels able to navigate the narrower waterways closer to the shore. Most docks are privately owned and dock owners take pride in owning the oldest possible dock in reverence to the cityâ€™s aquatic elven history.
		**The Fish Market:** The first part of the city that most people meet is the Fish Market. It is an open air market upon the boardwalks that crisscross the shore of the city. Local fishermen sell their catches here, but there are also agents of different groups. The Pickling Guild and Duke Ludwig both use their connections with fishermen and merchants who work the market to keep their eyes out for any interesting characters making their way into the city. 
		**The Customs Gate:** The gate is the only passageway between the Fish Market and the interior sections of the city. It is operated by the Coinsguard who ensure that the various taxes, tariffs, and regulations are paid and followed before anyone and anything goes from the unregulated market into the city proper. 
		**The Thirsty Mermaid:** The Mermaid, as it's known to the locals who give this bar their patronage. The owner is Adonis, an older human: barrel chested and bald with a thick graying beard. He was a sailor before retiring and using his savings to buying the bar. He still has the strong arms of a sailor (breaking up bar fights is a good way to stay in shape) and is chummy with his regulars, many of them former crewmates from his time on the seas. While the Mermaid doesn't offer lodging, Adonis is happy to direct patrons to the Broken Crane or even Giuseppe's Hearth if they have deep enough pockets. 
			**Services:** Food and drink. The menu usually includes whatever local catches they can procure from the fishermen and cheap wines from the vineyards of the island and whatever ales are being imported. 
	The Drydocks
		The Drydocks are the industrial heart of the city. This is where most of the artisans and craftsmen of the city sell their wares. 
		**Ingon's Smithery**
		**Daganae's Seajewels**
		**The Broken Crane**
			The largest tavern in the city. No one remembers what it used to be called, but since a crane fell through the building a number of years ago and became the new bartop after the following renovation everyone knows it as the Broken Crane. 
	Mayors' Square
		The smallest section of the city with the highest concentration of wealth and influence. Within this neighborhood are the homes and headquarters of the most powerful groups in the city. This is also the home of what may be the most well-known magical institutions in the world, [[The Lorehold]]. 
		**Coinsguard Central Command**
		**Turner's Trinkets and Moore:**
			A high end shoppe run by Abernathy Turner and Moore. After raiding some dungeons the [[Smallboiz]] brought some of their loot there to sell off and make some significant cash. 
		**Manor of the Lord Mayor:**
		**The Pickling Guild:**

Osstun Neighborhoods
	**The Coinsdock:**
		This was the largest section of the docks in Osstun. For some times, the Coinsguard were increasing their presence in the city in order to exert control over the duke. They had built up what had become known as the 'coinsdock' there as a barracks for their occupying force. 
		After forging an alliance with Duke Ludwig, the Small Boys helped him and [[Ulmed]] sabotage the docks.
