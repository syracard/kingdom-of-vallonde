Agros was the first ‘overworld’ settlement that the dwarves established. With easy access to stone, metals, and precious stones it became and early center of production, trade, and wealth for the early empire. Over the centuries the city grew and sprawled along the Stroden as its economy turned towards a more industrial nature. As the economic base transferred from Agros to other parts of the empire (and with the eventual collapse of the empire’s southern borders) the sprawl of the city turned to slums. Many people left, those who stayed received low wages for dangerous and abusive labor.
