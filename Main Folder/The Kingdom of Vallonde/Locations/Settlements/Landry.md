Landry was a small town in the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]]. It was primarily inhabited by half-Orcs and farmed rice in the river lowlands south of [[Farbrook Castle]]. 

The [[Smallboiz]] came by the town and made friends with the townsfolk, but sometime after meeting them, [[Piru, the Volcanic Rage]] flew over the town and burned it.
