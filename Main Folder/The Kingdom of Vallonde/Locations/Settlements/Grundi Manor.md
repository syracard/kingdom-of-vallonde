The familial home of Snorri Axebitter.
After Snorri was manipulated by the mutant aboleth, [[Luunthig]], most of the clan and the population were either killed or abandoned the manor and the bound town, Grunton. 
In the years following the area's abandonment it was raided and robbed, with most of the wealth being looted. 
After the [[Smallboiz]] defeated the aboleth who had been living in the lake, Snorri decided to begin renovating it and bringing life back to the area.
