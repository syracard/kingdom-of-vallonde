A large town south of [[Dorian's Rest]] along the eastern coast of the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]], Mayheath has served as the political capital of the kingdom since its founding. Since the rule of Piru, life in the city has been hit the hardest out of anywhere in the kingdom, the once populous city has been reduced to only around 1500 residents, leaving many homes and storefronts abandoned. 

Mayheath is administered by the Council of Five, elders from amongst the senior members of the neighborhoods, town guards, etc.
