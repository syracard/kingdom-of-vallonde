The Lorehold is a massive marble structure that houses one of the greatest magical schools in the world. It is located in the Mayors' Square district of Keyhearth among [[The Sister Cities]]. The building itself is a large, octagonal building with eight spires that twist up into the sky, defying mundane methods of construction. Each of the spires correspond to one of the schools of magic and the school is led by the [[Circle of Archmagi]] who are the ultimate authorities within their respective schools.

| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Abjuration    | Or'ell           |
| Conjuration   | Perfidy          |
| Divination    | Bellamy          |
| Enchantment   | [[Vaerik]]       |
| Evocation     | Kenrick          |
| Illusion      | Phanza Kalm      |
| Necromancy    | Gaius Tertullius |

The leadership of the Lorehold maintains strong relationships with [[The Five Families]] and [[The Coinsguard]], effecting a monopoly on the sale and trade of magical and enchanted items in the region. This ensures their high rate of income as well as being the chokepoint for individuals and organizations who wish to gain power in the cities.
