The Sunken Citadel wasn't always sunken. 

It was the home of one of the heroes who imprisoned [[Ashardalon]]. Located north of the town of [[Bybrook]], it was nestled against the mountains until an earthquake dropped it into a gorge. 

It sat empty for some time until it attracted various groups of kobolds and other villains who make their home in places like that. It was investigating these at the request of [[Madam Hucrele]] to find her niece and nephew that brought the [[Smallboiz]] there where they encountered the first of the massive crystal anchors that maintain Ashardalon's prision.
