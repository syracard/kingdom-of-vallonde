Farbrook Castle is the seat of [[Duke Damsor|Duke Reder Damsor]]. The garrison is commanded by [[Sir Barnabas]]. 

It has an anti-scrying chamber.

It has access to the [[Dwarven Lowway]] through its basement. 

In the spring of 757 [[Madam Hucrele]] led a small mercenary army that was materially supported by [[The Order of the Black Rose]] against the castle in an attempt to usurp the duke's title. With the help of the [[Smallboiz]], Farbrook stood still the home of Reder Damsor.
