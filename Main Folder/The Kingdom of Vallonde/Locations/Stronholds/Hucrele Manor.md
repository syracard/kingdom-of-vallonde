A manor house built against the [[Strodfjall Mountains]] roughly a day's ride from [[Bybrook]]. It was build by the Hurcrele family and was held by them until the demise of [[Madam Hucrele]]. 

In the mountains below the manor an [[Altar of Yawgmoth |altar]] was discovered that Kerowyn Hucrele attempted to use before it backfired on her. 

Since the death of Kerowyn, no one has stepped forward to claim ownership of the home while Snorri of the [[Smallboiz]]'s [[Raptor Riders]] occupy it and guard the altar along with [[Duke Damsor]]'s soldiers led by [[Sir Faisa]].
