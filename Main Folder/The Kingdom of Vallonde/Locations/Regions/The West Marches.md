The West Marches are a region west of the [[Tev'ash Empire]], and a former vassal of the Dwarven lords. They consist of a lake and forested valley that is separated from their former masters by the [[Strodfjall Mountains]]. 

The history of the Marches are sordid. Originally, they were an untamed region where bandits and warlords vied for control. Eventually, the empire sought control, and used their underground highways to circumvent the natural defenses of the mountains that protected the region. However, as the empire declined and the highways fell into disrepair, control over the Marches became more difficult. [[Emperor Krator]] (Empire 932-Kings 1) reorganized the Marches. They were no longer directly administered by the empire, but were ruled by 'Marcher Lords,' warlords who paid their vassalage to the emperor, but were allowed to fight amongst themselves for dominance of the regions. The emperor maintained the right to declare new lords, and split the region if they thought a single Marcher became too powerful. 

In the years since the decline of the Empire, while they still retain nominal control of the region and 'Master of the West Marches' is one of the titles that decorate the Emperor, it remains to be seen if the current Marchers would recognize imperial authority or even refrain from robbing them on sight.
