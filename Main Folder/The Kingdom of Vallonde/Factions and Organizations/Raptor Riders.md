The Raptor Riders are a company of Dwarven soldiers. They were originally a group of volunteers from the [[Tev'ash Empire]] who fought in the armies of [[The Republican Alliance]] in their war against a goblinoid incursion. After this conflict they were tasked with chasing down the remnants of that army and chased them into [[The Almyrotic Desert]] where they encountered the eponymous raptors that they learned to ride and became a cavalry unit. 

When they received word that [[Thimdurr]] had been claimed by a new champion, they gathered their forces to go and meet [[Smallboiz|Snorri]]. 

They are led by [[Mako]].
