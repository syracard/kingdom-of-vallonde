The Ulmist Inquisition is an order of monster hunters that was founded by the elf, [[Ulmed]]. They began under the darkness of [[Barovia]] and sought to undermine [[Strahd]]'s rule of that area. 

After the fall of Barovia, the inquisition became vagrant and eventually fell apart when the last of Ulmed's agents seemingly fell in their hunt of a mindflayer in the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]]. However, these hunters had simply been trapped in a stasis field. After they were saved by the [[Smallboiz]] and reconnected with their leader, the inquisition has been slowly rebuilding itself. 

In addition to its own reconstruction, the inquisition's other long term goal is to find a way to return Barovia to the material plane, cleanse it, and defeat Strahd once and for all.
