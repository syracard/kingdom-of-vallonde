Duke Ludwig is the latest duke of Osstun, the southern settlement of [[The Sister Cities]]. He is a half-elf who has come from a long line of dukes whose power has been eroded to the benefit of the lord mayors of Keyhearth and [[The Coinsguard]]. 

His father, despite his own poverty, offered haven to [[Ulmed]], an exile of [[Barovia]]. This forged a bond across generations and Ulmed has served the von Osstun family until the re-emergence of the [[Ulmist Inquisition]]. 

Ludwig sought a life better than his for his young family; one that was out from under the boots of the Coinsguard. To that end he began operating outside of the law, building a criminal enterprise that raided Keyhearth traders and sold their stolen gains on the black market. 

When the [[Smallboiz]] arrived in the Sister Cities they ran afoul of Ludwig's operation (and were even approached to assassinate him). However, they recognized his plight against the authority of Keyhearth and decided to support him, even creating lines of trade between his people and their other allies.
