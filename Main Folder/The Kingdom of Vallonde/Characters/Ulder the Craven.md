Ulder is the leader of a minor clan, the [[Clan Esagoga|Esagoga]], who resides in [[Last Hearth]]. The clan makes their wealth by controlling a portion of the trade of magical and historical artifacts through the [[Tev'ash Empire]]. [[The Order of the Black Rose]] contracted with Ulder to provide potent items and artifacts for [[Piru, the Volatile]]. He contracted with the [[Immortal Legion]] to provide these, and in the process of doing so discovered an artifact that creates a permanent 100-foot-radius *Antipathy* (Undead) spell, [[The Perandus Keystone]]. 
Ulder used the Keystone to create a safehouse to protect himself from the Legion when he skipped out on payment after he had completed his contract with the Order.
