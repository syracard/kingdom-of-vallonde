Soth was a knight of [[Barovia]] who was one of [[Strahd]]'s most loyal servants. Through the course of the fall of Barovia, Soth's family were killed and in his despair he became a scion of Bane in an effort to attain the power to bring his family back. 

Through his service to the Lord of Darkness, Soth became a death knight and created the [[Immortal Legion]]. Eventually, Soth realized that Bane would never give him back his family, and was only taking advantage of Soth's desperation. In response, Soth destroyed Bane's cults on the material plane and slew the god of tyranny himself, the first death of [[The Dead Three]].

In his divine death throes, Bane cursed Soth to never see his family again. He now searches for a way to break the curse.
