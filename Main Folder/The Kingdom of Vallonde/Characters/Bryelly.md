Bryelly is a human in her mid 20s with messy copper hair and amber eyes. She wears plain clothing and carries a cedar staff. 

Bryelly grew up in [[The Sister Cities|Osstun]] where she was childhood friends with the boy who would become [[Captain Jacques]]. Her father was a fence for [[Ludwig von Osstun|Duke Ludwig]] who taught her the shrewd mercantile skill that she now uses for the [[The Five Families|Jolood Family]]. 

Unlike Jacque she turned her back on Osstun after her father died and she found work with the Jolood Family. She served as their point person in contact with [[Madam Hucrele]]. Through working with the Hucrele Family, she met the [[Smallboiz]] and referred them to Jacques when they travelled to Keyhearth. 

She managed to get out of [[Hucrele Manor]] before the ramifications of Kerowyn's demise reached there.
