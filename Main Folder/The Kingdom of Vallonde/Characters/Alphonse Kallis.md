General Kallis is an older, male dwarf. While he came from a prominent clan, he rose through the ranks due to his skill as leader and his respect for the hierarchy of the Empire. While he recognizes that there are problems with the system, he would endorse reform over outright revolution. 

He is the commander of Legion IV and leads the garrison of [[Agros]] from [[Stone Keep]].
