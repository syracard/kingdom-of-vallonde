Athlonia is the leader of [[The Coinsguard]]. She maintains the rule of law while subtly expanding her reach and influence in [[The Sister Cities]]. 

She came to Keyhearth in the Kings 740s after serving [[Dukesfane]] in their war against a goblinoid army. Athlonia had earned wide renown as an accomplished military leader, though her reasons for leaving Dukesfane were shrouded in mystery. By all accounts she had a good relationship with [[Grand Duke Aeglforth]], so it was a pleasant surprise when she offered her services to lead the Coinsguard. 

In secret, Athlonia is a devotee of Bane and the leader of his [[The Knighthood of Bane |knights]]. 

For a time, she employed [[Captain Odric]] as the leader of her intelligence operation until he was destroyed by the [[Smallboiz]]. 

Athlonia is the descendent of the Elven mage, [[Athlonion]], who was the architect of the prison to contain [[Ashardalon]].
