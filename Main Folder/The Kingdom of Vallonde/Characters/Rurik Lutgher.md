Rurik runs the local blacksmith in [[Bybrook]] and is a nephew of [[Fallond Lutgher]], a member of the [[Onssbruck Cartel]]. 

He made fast friends with the [[Small Boys]] when they started using the town as a hub for their adventuring activities. He even became an initial investor and operator of their mining operations in the area. 

After some time as the political situation in the [[Kingdom of Vallonde]] became more volatile Rurik facilitated the introduction between the Small Boys and [[Amil Vallo]].
