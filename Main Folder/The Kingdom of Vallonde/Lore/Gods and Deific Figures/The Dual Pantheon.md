Gods divided into Apollonian(Order) and Dionysian(Disorder). Not seen as necessarily antagonist towards one another, but their followers take them that way from time to time. 

Different Interpretations 
	1. the gods were once a single entity, but they were sundered and fractured into the different beings who are now worshiped
	2. The 'different' gods are just different cultural or regional interpretations of Apollo and Dionysus.

Apollonian Prayer
	Apollo brings truth and understanding,  
	wit and wisdom fair,  
	Precious gifts beyond compare.  
	We can build a world of wonder,  
	He can make us all aware. 
	He will find us food and shelter,  
	Show us fire to keep us warm  
	Through the endless winter storm.  
	You can live in grace and comfort  
	In the world that you transform.

Dionysian Prayer
	In the darkness of the night  
	In the Heartâ€™s eternal light  
	Dionysus brings love to give us solace
	You need only trust your feelings  
	Only Love can steer you right
	He brings laughter, He brings Music,  
	He brings joy and He brings Tears  
	He will soothe your primal fears  
	Throw off those chains of Reason  
	And your prison disappears
