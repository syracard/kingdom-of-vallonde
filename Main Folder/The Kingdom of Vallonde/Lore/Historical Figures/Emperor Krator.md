(Empire 932-Kings 1)

Krator is widely considered to have presided over the collapse of the [[Tev'ash Empire]]. While he negotiated the reorganization of [[The West Marches]], he also lost the war against [[Dorian I]], releasing the southern lands of the empire to an independent [[Kingdom of Vallonde]].
