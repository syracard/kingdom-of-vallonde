Zealcleaver is a stone greatsword, etched with the inscriptions of the holy tablets that were used to craft it. It is a profane mockery of Erathis, being forged from one of the holy relics of his church. 

It was procured by [[Captain Odric]], before being taken from him by Smallzo of the [[Smallboiz]].
