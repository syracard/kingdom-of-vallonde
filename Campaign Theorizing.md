First question is if there's a campaign/setting the players wanna play in!

**Setting/Story**
	Centered in 'Byzantium Setting' to the east. Let's avoid Orientalist tropes.
		Ba Sing Se/AOT style massive multi-walled city
	Ya'll are the sidekicks of retired heroes "Get the Gang Back" inspired thingy
	Early colonial type exploration (Either Caribbean or continental).
**Party Dynamic**
	Suicide Squad/BG3 forced interaction
		Maybe use a magic tattoo type thingy?
			Geometric designs that grow to provide additional abilities when certain actions are completed.
